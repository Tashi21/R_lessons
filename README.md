# R Lessons

## Introduction
This is a small repository of R markdown files created for the course *Introduction to Digital Humanities* at [Ashoka University](www.ashoka.edu.in). Students are expected to fork the repository and open the self-contained markdown file with the walkthrough. This repository will be updated to include more lesson plans in the future.
