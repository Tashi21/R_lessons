19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Beyond the spaceport gates, the men of the Kharsa were hunting down a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"thief. I heard the shrill cries, the pad-padding of feet in strides just",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"a little too long and loping to be human, raising echoes all down the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,dark and dusty streets leading up to the main square.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,But the square itself lay empty in the crimson noon of Wolf. Overhead,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the dim red ember of Phi Coronis, Wolf's old and dying sun, gave out a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"pale and heatless light. The pair of Spaceforce guards at the gates,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wearing the black leathers of the Terran Empire, shockers holstered at",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"their belts, were drowsing under the arched gateway where the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"star-and-rocket emblem proclaimed the domain of Terra. One of them, a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"snub-nosed youngster only a few weeks out from Earth, cocked an",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"inquisitive ear at the cries and scuffling feet, then jerked his head at",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Hey, Cargill, you can talk their lingo. What's going on out there?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I stepped out past the gateway to listen. There was still no one to be,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"seen in the square. It lay white and windswept, a barricade of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,emptiness; to one side the spaceport and the white skyscraper of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Terran Headquarters, and at the other side, the clutter of low",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"buildings, the street-shrine, the little spaceport cafe smelling of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"coffee and _jaco_, and the dark opening mouths of streets that rambled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"down into the Kharsa--the old town, the native quarter. But I was alone",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in the square with the shrill cries--closer now, raising echoes from the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,enclosing walls--and the loping of many feet down one of the dirty,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,streets.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then I saw him running, dodging, a hail of stones flying round his head;",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,someone or something small and cloaked and agile. Behind him the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,still-faceless mob howled and threw stones. I could not yet understand,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the cries; but they were out for blood, and I knew it.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I said briefly, ""Trouble coming,"" just before the mob spilled out into",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the square. The fleeing dwarf stared about wildly for an instant, his",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,head jerking from side to side so rapidly that it was impossible to get,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"even a fleeting impression of his face--human or nonhuman, familiar or",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"bizarre. Then, like a pellet loosed from its sling, he made straight for",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the gateway and safety.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And behind him the loping mob yelled and howled and came pouring over,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,half the square. Just half. Then by that sudden intuition which,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"permeates even the most crazed mob with some semblance of reason, they",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"came to a ragged halt, heads turning from side to side.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I stepped up on the lower step of the Headquarters building, and looked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,them over.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Most of them were _chaks_, the furred man-tall nonhumans of the Kharsa,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and not the better class. Their fur was unkempt, their tails naked with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,filth and disease. Their leather aprons hung in tatters. One or two in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the crowd were humans, the dregs of the Kharsa. But the star-and-rocket",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,emblem blazoned across the spaceport gates sobered even the wildest,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,blood-lust somewhat; they milled and shifted uneasily in their half of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the square.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,For a moment I did not see where their quarry had gone. Then I saw him,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"crouched, not four feet from me, in a patch of shadow. Simultaneously",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the mob saw him, huddled just beyond the gateway, and a howl of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,frustration and rage went ringing round the square. Someone threw a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stone. It zipped over my head, narrowly missing me, and landed at the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,feet of the black-leathered guard. He jerked his head up and gestured,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with the shocker which had suddenly come unholstered.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The gesture should have been enough. On Wolf, Terran law has been",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,written in blood and fire and exploding atoms; and the line is drawn,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"firm and clear. The men of Spaceforce do not interfere in the old town,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,or in any of the native cities. But when violence steps over the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"threshold, passing the blazon of the star and rocket, punishment is",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,swift and terrible. The threat should have been enough.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Instead a howl of abuse went up from the crowd.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""_Terranan!_""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Son of the Ape!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The Spaceforce guards were shoulder to shoulder behind me now. The,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"snub-nosed kid, looking slightly pale, called out. ""Get inside the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"gates, Cargill! If I have to shoot--""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The older man motioned him to silence. ""Wait. Cargill,"" he called.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I nodded to show that I heard.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""You talk their lingo. Tell them to haul off! Damned if I want to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shoot!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I stepped down and walked into the open square, across the crumbled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"white stones, toward the ragged mob. Even with two armed Spaceforce men",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"at my back, it made my skin crawl, but I flung up my empty hand in token",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of peace:,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Take your mob out of the square,"" I shouted in the jargon of the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kharsa. ""This territory is held in compact of peace! Settle your",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"quarrels elsewhere!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,There was a little stirring in the crowd. The shock of being addressed,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in their own tongue, instead of the Terran Standard which the Empire has",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"forced on Wolf, held them silent for a minute. I had learned that long",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,ago: that speaking in any of the languages of Wolf would give me a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,minute's advantage.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"But only a minute. Then one of the mob yelled, ""We'll go if you give'm",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"to us! He's no right to Terran sanctuary!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I walked over to the huddled dwarf, miserably trying to make himself",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,smaller against the wall. I nudged him with my foot.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Get up. Who are you?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The hood fell away from his face as he twitched to his feet. He was,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"trembling violently. In the shadow of the hood I saw a furred face, a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"quivering velvety muzzle, and great soft golden eyes which held",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,intelligence and terror.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""What have you done? Can't you talk?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He held out the tray which he had shielded under his cloak, an ordinary",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"peddler's tray. ""Toys. Sell toys. Children. You got'm?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I shook my head and pushed the creature away, with only a glance at the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"array of delicately crafted manikins, tiny animals, prisms and crystal",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"whirligigs. ""You'd better get out of here. Scram. Down that street."" I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,pointed.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"A voice from the crowd shouted again, and it had a very ugly sound. ""He",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"is a spy of Nebran!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""_Nebran--_"" The dwarfish nonhuman gabbled something then doubled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"behind me. I saw him dodge, feint in the direction of the gates, then,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"as the crowd surged that way, run for the street-shrine across the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"square, slipping from recess to recess of the wall. A hail of stones",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,went flying in that direction. The little toy-seller dodged into the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,street-shrine.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then there was a hoarse ""Ah, aaah!"" of terror, and the crowd edged away,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"surged backward. The next minute it had begun to melt away, its entity",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"dissolving into separate creatures, slipping into the side alleys and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the dark streets that disgorged into the square. Within three minutes,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the square lay empty again in the pale-crimson noon.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The kid in black leather let his breath go and swore, slipping his",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shocker into its holster. He stared and demanded profanely, ""Where'd the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"little fellow go?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Who knows?"" the other shrugged. ""Probably sneaked into one of the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"alleys. Did you see where he went, Cargill?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I came slowly back to the gateway. To me, it had seemed that he ducked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"into the street-shrine and vanished into thin air, but I've lived on",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Wolf long enough to know you can't trust your eyes here. I said so, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the kid swore again, gulping, more upset than he wanted to admit. ""Does",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"this kind of thing happen often?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""All the time,"" his companion assured him soberly, with a sidewise wink",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,at me. I didn't return the wink.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The kid wouldn't let it drop. ""Where did you learn their lingo, Mr.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Cargill?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""I've been on Wolf a long time,"" I said, spun on my heel and walked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"toward Headquarters. I tried not to hear, but their voices followed me",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"anyhow, discreetly lowered, but not lowered enough.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Kid, don't you know who he is? That's Cargill of the Secret Service!",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"lowered another decibel, and then there was the kid's voice asking,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shaken, ""But what the hell happened to his face?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I should have been used to it by now. I'd been hearing it, more or less",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"behind my back, for six years. Well, if my luck held, I'd never hear it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"again. I strode up the white steps of the skyscraper, to finish the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"vapor lamps, and a chained-down skyscraper of a starship, littered over",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with swarming ants. The process crew was getting the big ship ready for,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""My name's Cargill. Have you a pass for me?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"spacemen, which I obviously wasn't. ""Let me check my records,"" he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hedged, and punched scanning buttons on the glassy surface. Shadows came",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and went, and I saw myself half-reflected, a tipsy shadow in a flurry of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,I admitted it and he started punching more buttons when the sound of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,another world from the neat bright Trade City which lay west of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"of human and half-human life. A naked child, diminutive and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"golden-furred, darted between two of the chinked pebble-houses, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,respected within earshot of their gates. But there had been rioting here,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and in Charin during the last month. After the display of mob violence,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"inconspicuous, a worn shirtcloak hunched round my shoulders, weaponless",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,except for the razor-sharp skean in the clasp of the cloak; walking on,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"markets, the walk and step of the Dry-towners from Shainsa and Daillon",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and Ardcarran--the parched cities of dusty, salt stone which spread out",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in the bottoms of Wolf's vanished oceans. Rakhal was from Shainsa,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"human, tall as an Earthman, weathered by salt and sun, and he had worked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Even now I was not wholly sure why he had erupted, that day, into",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I strode the streets of the slum unseeing, my thoughts running a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,That had been six years ago. One more adventure had shown me that my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"had left me a legacy: my name, written on the sure scrolls of death",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"anywhere outside the safe boundaries of Terran law. A marked man, I had",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,gone back to slow stagnation behind a desk. I'd stood it as long as I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,could.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"When it finally got too bad, Magnusson had been sympathetic. He was the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I was nearly back to the spaceport by now, across from the street-shrine",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,at the edge of the square. It was here that the little toy-seller had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"vanished. But it was exactly like a thousand, a hundred thousand other",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"such street-shrines on Wolf, a smudge of incense reeking and stinking",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"before the squatting image of Nebran, the Toad God whose face and symbol",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"are everywhere on Wolf. I stared for a moment at the ugly idol, then",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,slowly moved away.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The lighted curtains of the spaceport cafe attracted my attention and I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,went inside. A few spaceport personnel in storm gear were drinking,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"coffee at the counter, a pair of furred _chaks_, lounging beneath the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"mirrors at the far end, and a trio of Dry-towners, rangy, weathered men",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in crimson and blue shirt cloaks, were standing at a wall shelf, eating",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Terran food with aloof dignity.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A snub-nosed girl with alabaster hair came to take my order. I asked for,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"_jaco_ and bunlets, and carried the food to a wall shelf near the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dry-towners. Their dialect fell soft and familiar on my ears. One of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"them, without altering the expression on his face or the easy tone of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"his voice, began to make elaborate comments on my entrance, my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"appearance, my ancestry and probably personal habits, all defined in the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,colorfully obscene dialect of Shainsa.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,That had happened before. The Wolfan sense of humor is only half-human.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,In my civilian clothes I was obviously fair game.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A look or gesture of resentment would have lost face and dignity--what,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the Dry-towners call their _kihar_--permanently. I leaned over and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"remarked in their own dialect that I would, at some future and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"unspecified time, appreciate the opportunity to return their",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,compliments.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"By rights they should have laughed, made some barbed remark about my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,command of language and crossed their hands in symbol of a jest decently,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,and that would be that.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,But it didn't happen that way. Not this time. The tallest of the three,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"whirled, upsetting his drink in the process. I heard its thin shatter",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"through the squeal of the alabaster-haired girl, as a chair crashed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"over. They faced me three abreast, and one of them fumbled in the clasp",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of his shirtcloak.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I edged backward, my own hand racing up for a skean I hadn't carried in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"six years, and fronted them squarely, hoping I could face down the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"prospect of a roughhouse. They wouldn't kill me, this close to the HQ,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,but at least I was in for an unpleasant mauling. I couldn't handle three,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"men; and if nerves were this taut in the Kharsa, I might get knifed.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Quite by accident, of course.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The _chaks_ moaned and gibbered. The Dry-towners glared at me and I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,tensed for the moment when their steady stare would explode into,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,violence.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then I became aware that they were gazing, not at me, but at something",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,or someone behind me. The skeans snicked back into the clasps of their,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,cloaks.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then they broke rank, turned and ran. They _ran_, blundering into",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stools, leaving havoc of upset benches and broken crockery in their",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wake. One man barged into the counter, swore and ran on, limping. I let",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"my breath go. Something had put the fear of God into those brutes, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,it wasn't my own ugly mug. I turned and saw the girl.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She was slight, with waving hair like spun black glass, circled with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,faint tracery of stars. A black glass belt bound her narrow waist like,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"clasped hands, and her robe, stark white, bore an ugly embroidery across",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the breasts, the flat sprawl of a conventionalized Toad God, Nebran. Her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"features were delicate, chiseled, pale; a Dry-town face, all human, all",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"woman, but set in an alien and unearthly repose. The great eyes gleamed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"phrase formal thanks, then broke off in astonishment. The cafe had",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,emptied and we were entirely alone. Even the _chaks_ had leaped through,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,an open window--I saw the whisk of a disappearing tail.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"We stood frozen, looking at one another while the Toad God sprawled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,across her breasts rose and fell for half a dozen breaths.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then I took one step forward, and she took one step backward, at the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,same instant. In one swift movement she was outside in the dark street.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"It took me only an instant to get into the street after her, but as I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stepped across the door there was a little stirring in the air, like the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rising of heat waves across the salt flats at noon. Then the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"street-shrine was empty, and nowhere was there any sign of the girl. She",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,had vanished. She simply was not there.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I gaped at the empty shrine. She had stepped inside and vanished, like a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wraith of smoke, like--",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,--Like the little toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"There were eyes in the street again and, becoming aware of where I was,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I moved away. The shrines of Nebran are on every corner of Wolf, but",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,this is one instance when familiarity does not breed contempt. The,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"street was dark and seemed empty, but it was packed with all the little",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,noises of living. I was not unobserved. And meddling with a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,street-shrine would be just as dangerous as the skeans of my three,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"From the spaceport gates, exchanging brief greetings with the guards, I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,took a last look at the Kharsa. For a minute I toyed with the notion of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,just disappearing down one of those streets. It's not hard to disappear,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"on Wolf, if you know how. And I knew, or had known once. Loyalty to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Terra? What had Terra given me except a taste of color and adventure,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"out there in the Dry-towns, and then taken it away again?",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"If an Earthman is very lucky and very careful, he lasts about ten years",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,in Intelligence. I had had two years more than my share. I still knew,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,enough to leave my Terran identity behind like a worn-out jacket. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"could seek out Rakhal, settle our blood-feud, see Juli again....",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,How could I see Juli again? As her husband's murderer? No other way.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Blood-feud on Wolf is a terrible and elaborate ritual of the code,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"duello. And once I stepped outside the borders of Terran law, sooner or",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,later Rakhal and I would meet. And one of us would die.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I looked back, just once, at the dark rambling streets away from the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"square. Then I turned toward the blue-white lights that hurt my eyes,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and the starship that loomed, huge and hateful, before me.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A steward in white took my fingerprint and led me to a coffin-sized,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"chamber. He brought me coffee and sandwiches--I hadn't, after all, eaten",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in the spaceport cafe--then got me into the skyhook and strapped me,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"deftly and firmly, into the acceleration cushions, tugging at the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Garensen belts until I ached all over. A long needle went into my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,arm--the narcotic that would keep me safely drowsy all through the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,terrible tug of interstellar acceleration.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Doors clanged, buzzers vibrated lower down in the ship, men tramped the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,corridors calling to one another in the language of the spaceports. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"understood one word in four. I shut my eyes, not caring. At the end of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the trip there would be another star, another world, another language.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Another life.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I had spent all my adult life on Wolf. Juli had been a child under the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,red star. But it was a pair of wide crimson eyes and black hair combed,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,into ringlets like spun black glass that went down with me into the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,bottomless pit of sleep....,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,Someone was shaking me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Ah, come on, Cargill. Wake up, man. Shake your boots!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"My mouth, foul-tasting and stiff, fumbled at the shapes of words. ""Wha'",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"happened? Wha' y' want?"" My eyes throbbed. When I got them open I saw",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,two men in black leathers bending over me. We were still inside gravity.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"criminal, under interstellar law, can be removed from a passage-paid",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Did I say you had?"" snapped one man.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Shut up, he's doped,"" the other said hurriedly. ""Look,"" he continued,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"pronouncing every word loudly and distinctly, ""get up now, and come with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"minutes, and Operations will scream. Come on, please.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then I was stumbling along the lighted, empty corridor, swaying between",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the two men, foggily realizing the crew must think me a fugitive caught",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,trying to leave the planet.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The locks dilated. A uniformed spaceman watched us, fussily regarding a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"chronometer. He fretted. ""The dispatcher's office--""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""We're doing the best we can,"" the Spaceforce man said. ""Can you walk,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Cargill?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I could, though my feet were a little shaky on the ladders. The violet",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"moonlight had deepened to mauve, and gusty winds spun tendrils of grit",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"across my face. The Spaceforce men shepherded me, one on either side, to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the gateway.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""What the hell is all this? Is something wrong with my pass?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The guard shook his head. ""How would I know? Magnusson put out the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"order, take it up with him.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Believe me,"" I muttered, ""I will.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"They looked at each other. ""Hell,"" said one, ""he's not under arrest, we",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,don't have to haul him around like a convict. Can you walk all right,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"now, Cargill? You know where the Secret Service office is, don't you?",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Floor 38. The Chief wants you, and make it fast.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I knew it made no sense to ask questions, they obviously knew no more",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,than I did. I asked anyhow.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Are they holding the ship for me? I'm supposed to be leaving on it.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Not that one,"" the guard answered, jerking his head toward the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,spaceport. I looked back just in time to see the dust-dimmed ship leap,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"upward, briefly whitened in the field searchlights, and vanish into the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,surging clouds above.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"My head was clearing fast, and anger speeded up the process. The HQ",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,building was empty in the chill silence of just before dawn. I had to,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"rout out a dozing elevator operator, and as the lift swooped upward my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,anger rose with it. I wasn't working for Magnusson any more. What right,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had he, or anybody, to grab me off an outbound starship like a criminal?",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"By the time I barged into his office, I was spoiling for a fight.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The Secret Service office was full of grayish-pink morning and yellow,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"lights left on from the night before. Magnusson, at his desk, looked as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"if he'd slept in his rumpled uniform. He was a big bull of a man, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"his littered desk looked, as always, like the track of a typhoon in the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,salt flats.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The clutter was weighted down, here and there, with solidopic cubes of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the five Magnusson youngsters, and as usual, Magnusson was fiddling with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"one of the cubes. He said, not looking up, ""Sorry to pull this at the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"last minute, Race. There was just time to put out a pull order and get",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"you off the ship, but no time to explain.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I glared at him. ""Seems I can't even get off the planet without trouble!",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"You raised hell all the time I was here, but when I try to leave--what",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"is this, anyhow? I'm sick of being shoved around!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Magnusson made a conciliating gesture. ""Wait until you hear--"" he began,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and broke off, looking at someone who was sitting in the chair in front",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of his desk, somebody whose back was turned to me. Then the person",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"twisted and I stopped cold, blinking and wondering if this were a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hallucination and I'd wake up in the starship's skyhook, far out in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,space.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then the woman cried, ""Race, _Race_! Don't you know me?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I took one dazed step and another. Then she flew across the space,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"between us, her thin arms tangling around my neck, and I caught her up,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,still disbelieving.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I let her cry for a minute, then held my sister at arm's length. For a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,moment I had forgotten the six years that lay between us. Now I saw,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"them, all of them, printed plain on her face. Juli had been a pretty",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"girl. Six years had fined her face into beauty, but there was tension in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the set of her shoulders, and her gray eyes had looked on horrors.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,She looked tiny and thin and unbearably frail under the scanty folds of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"her fur robe, a Dry-town woman's robe. Her wrists were manacled, the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,jeweled tight bracelets fastened together by the links of a long fine,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"chain of silvered gilt that clashed a little, thinly, as her hands fell",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to her sides.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""What's wrong, Juli? Where's Rakhal?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,She shivered and now I could see that she was in a state of shock.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Gone. He's gone, that's all I know. And--oh, Race, Race, he took Rindy",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"with him!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,From the tone of her voice I had thought she was sobbing. Now I realized,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,that her eyes were dry; she was long past tears. Gently I unclasped her,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"clenched fingers and put her back in the chair. She sat like a doll, her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,hands falling to her sides with a thin clash of chains. When I picked,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,them up and laid them in her lap she let them lie there motionless. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stood over her and demanded, ""Who's Rindy?"" She didn't move.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""My daughter, Race. Our little girl.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"For the first time Juli showed a sign of animation. ""I was afraid to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"She turned to me. ""I shouldn't have come for myself--""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I knew that. Juli was proud, and she had always had the courage to live",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"with her own mistakes. When I first saw her, I knew this wouldn't be",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,anything so simple as the complaint of an abused wife or even an,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"abandoned or deserted mother. I took a chair, watching her and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,listening.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She began. ""You made a mistake when you turned Rakhal out of the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Juli did not continue, obviously awaiting his answer, he said, ""Juli, he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Shainsa.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I wasn't surprised. The Dry-towns were the core of Terran trade on Wolf,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and it was through their cooperation that Terra existed here peaceably,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"on a world only half human, or less.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The men of the Dry-towns existed strangely poised between two worlds.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"They had made dealings with the first Terran ships, and thus gave",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,entrance to the wedge of the Terran Empire. And yet they stood proud and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,apart. They alone had never yielded to the Terranizing which overtakes,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,all Empire planets sooner or later.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,There were no Trade Cities in the Dry-towns; an Earthman who went there,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"unprotected faced a thousand deaths, each one worse than the last. There",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,were those who said that the men of Shainsa and Daillon and Ardcarran,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had sold the rest of Wolf to the Terrans, to keep the Terrans from their",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Even Rakhal, who had worked with Terra since boyhood, had finally come",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to a point of decision and gone his own way. And it was not Terra's way.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,That was what Juli was saying now.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""He didn't like what Terra was doing on Wolf. I'm not so sure I like it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"myself--""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Magnusson interrupted her again. ""Do you know what Wolf was like when we",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"came here? Have you seen the Slave Colony, the Idiot's Village? Your own",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""And Rakhal helped him!"" Juli reminded him. ""Even after he left you, he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,tried to keep out of things. He could have told them a good deal that,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"would hurt you, after ten years in Intelligence, you know.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I knew. It was, although I wasn't going to tell Juli this, one reason",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"why, at the end--during that terrible explosion of violence which no",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,normal Terran mind could comprehend--I had done my best to kill him. We,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had both known that after this, the planet would not hold the two of us.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,We could both go on living only by dividing it unevenly. I had been,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,given the slow death of the Terran Zone. And he had all the rest.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""But he never told them anything! I tell you, he was one of the most",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She didn't, not immediately. Instead she asked what sounded like an",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"irrelevant question. ""Is it true what he told me? That the Empire has a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"standing offer of a reward for a working model of a matter transmitter?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""That offer's been standing for three hundred years, Terran reckoning.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""I don't think so. But I think he heard rumors about one. He said with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,that kind of money he could bargain the Terrans right out of Shainsa.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"That was where it started. He began coming and going at odd times, but",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"he never said any more about it. He wouldn't talk to me at all.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""When was all this?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""About four months ago.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""In other words, just about the time of the riots in Charin.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She nodded. ""Yes. He was away in Charin when the Ghost Wind blew, and he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,came back with knife cuts in his thigh. I asked if he had been mixed-up,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in the anti-Terran rioting, but he wouldn't tell me. Race, I don't know",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"anything about politics. I don't really care. But just about that time,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the Great House in Shainsa changed hands. I'm sure Rakhal had something,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to do with that.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""And then--"" Juli twisted her chained hands together in her lap--""he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"sort of nonhuman toy from one of the lowland towns, Charin I think. It",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was a weird thing, scared me. But he'd sit Rindy down in the sunlight",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and have her look into it, and Rindy would gabble all sorts of nonsense",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"about little men and birds and a toymaker.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The chains about Juli's wrists clashed as she twisted her hands,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"together. I stared somberly at the fetters. The chain, which was long,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,did not really hamper her movements much. Such chains were symbolic,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"ornaments, and most Dry-town women went all their lives with fettered",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hands. But even after the years I'd spent in the Dry-towns, the sight",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"still brought an uneasiness to my throat, a vague discomfort.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""We had a terrible fight over that,"" Juli went on. ""I was afraid, afraid",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of what it was doing to Rindy. I threw it out, and Rindy woke up and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"been forcing back broke free, and she rocked back and forth in her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"But Mack, please, don't do anything against him, please, please. He's",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I could see that, too, but Juli's agonized face came between me and the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"picture of disaster. I clenched my fist around the chair arm, not",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"surprised to see the fragile plastic buckle, crack and split under my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"A hope was born in her ravaged face, and died, while I looked. ""Race,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""He'd try,"" I admitted. The moment Rakhal knew I was outside the Terran",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"zone, I'd walk with death. I had accepted the code during my years in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Shainsa. But now I was an Earthman and felt only contempt.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Can't you see? Once he knows I'm at large, that very code of his will",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"force him to abandon any intrigue, whatever you call it, conspiracy, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,come after me first. That way we do two things: we get him out of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"her, not gently, my hands biting her shoulders. ""And I won't kill him,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,do you hear? He may wish I had; by the time I get through with him--I'll,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,beat the living hell out of him; I'll cram my fists down his throat. But,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I'll settle it with him like an Earthman. I won't kill him. _Hear me,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Juli?_ Because that's the worst thing I could do to him--catch him and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"let him live afterward!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Magnusson stepped toward me and pried my crushing hands off her arms.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Juli rubbed the bruises mechanically, not knowing she was doing it. Mack",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"said, ""You can't do it, Cargill. You wouldn't get as far as Daillon. You",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"haven't been out of the zone in six years. Besides--""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"His eyes rested full on my face. ""I hate to say this, Race, but damn it,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"man, go and take a good look at yourself in a mirror. Do you think I'd",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,ever have pulled you off the Secret Service otherwise? How in hell can,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""There are plenty of scarred men in the Dry-towns,"" I said. ""Rakhal will",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Magnusson walked to the window. His huge form bulked against the light,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"perceptibly darkening the office. He looked over the faraway panorama,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the neat bright Trade City below and the vast wilderness lying outside.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I could almost hear the wheels grinding in his head. Finally he swung,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Race, I've heard these rumors before. But you're the only man I could",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I heard the harsh inward gasp of Juli's breath and said, ""Damn it, no.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The first move you make--"" I couldn't finish. Rindy was in his hands,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and when I knew Rakhal, he hadn't been given to making idle threats. We",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,all three knew what Rakhal might do at the first hint of the long arm of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Terran law reaching out for him.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I said, ""For God's sake let's keep Spaceforce out of it. Let it look",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"the clear plastic, where the three-dimensional image of a nine-year-old",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"girl looked out at him, smiling and innocent. His face was transparent",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"as the plastic cube. Mack acts tough, but he has five kids and he is as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,soft as a dish of pudding where a kid is concerned.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"What chance would we have, if it turned into a full-scale rebellion?",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"None at all, unless we wanted to order a massacre. Sure, we have bombs",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and dis-guns and all that.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""But would we dare to use them? And where would we be after that? We're",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"here to keep the pot from boiling over, to keep out of planetary",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"incidents, not push them along to a point where bluff won't work. That's",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,By sunset I was ready to leave. I hadn't had any loose ends to tie up in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the Trade City, since I'd already disposed of most of my gear before",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,boarding the starship. I'd never been in better circumstances to take,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,off for parts unknown.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Mack, still disapproving, had opened the files to me, and I'd spent most",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the day in the back rooms of Floor 38, searching Intelligence files",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"to refresh my memory, scanning the pages of my own old reports sent",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,years ago from Shainsa and Daillon. He had sent out one of the nonhumans,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"who worked for us, to buy or acquire somewhere in the Old Town a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dry-towner's outfit and the other things I would wear and carry.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I would have liked to go myself. I felt that I needed the practice. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,was only now beginning to realize how much I might have forgotten in the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"years behind a desk. But until I was ready to make my presence known, no",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,one must know that Race Cargill had not left Wolf on the starship.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Above all, I must not be seen in the Kharsa until I went there in the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Dry-town disguise which had become, years ago, a deep second nature,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,almost an alternate personality.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,About sunset I walked through the clean little streets of the Terran,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Trade City toward the Magnusson home where Juli was waiting for me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Most of the men who go into Civil Service of the Empire come from Earth,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,or from the close-in planets of Proxima and Alpha Centaurus. They go out,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"unmarried, and they stay that way, or marry women native to the planets",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,where they are sent.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,But Joanna Magnusson was one of the rare Earth women who had come out,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"with her husband, twenty years ago. There are two kinds of Earthwomen",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"like that. They make their quarterings a little bit of home, or a little",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,bit of hell. Joanna had made their house look like a transported corner,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of Earth.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I never knew quite what to think of the Magnusson household. It seemed,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,I thanked him and carried the bundle inside. In the empty back room I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,stripped to the skin and unrolled the bundle. There was a pair of baggy,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"striped breeches, a worn and shabby shirtcloak with capacious pockets, a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,looped belt with half the gilt rubbed away and the base metal showing,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"through, and a scuffed pair of ankle-boots tied with frayed thongs of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,different colors. There was a little cluster of amulets and seals. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"chose two or three of the commonest kind, and strung them around my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"pocket of my shirtcloak, and chewed a few of the buds, wrinkling my nose",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,at the long-unfamiliar pungency.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The second lump was a skean, and unlike the worn and shabby garments,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"this was brand-new and sharp and bright, and its edge held a razor",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,It was the only weapon I could dare to carry.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The last of the solid objects in the bundle was a flat wooden case,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,about nine by ten inches. I slid it open. It was divided carefully into,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sections cushioned with sponge-absorbent plastic, and in them lay tiny",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"slips of glass, on Wolf as precious as jewels. They were lenses--camera",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"lenses, microscope lenses, even eyeglass lenses. Packed close, there",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,were nearly a hundred of them nested by the shock-absorbent stuff.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,They were my excuse for travel to Shainsa. Over and above the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"necessities of trade, a few items of Terran manufacture--vacuum tubes,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"transistors, lenses for cameras and binoculars, liquors and finely",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Even in cities where Terrans have never gone, these things bring",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"exorbitant prices, and trading in them is a Dry-town privilege. Rakhal",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had been a trader, so Juli told me, in fine wire and surgical",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"instruments. Wolf is not a mechanized planet, and has never developed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,any indigenous industrial system; the psychology of the nonhuman seldom,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,runs to technological advances.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I went down the hallway again to the room where Juli was waiting.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Catching a glimpse in a full-length mirror, I was startled. All traces",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the Terran civil servant, clumsy and uncomfortable in his ill-fitting",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"clothes, had dropped away. A Dry-towner, rangy and scarred, looked out",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"at me, and it seemed that the expression on his face was one of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,amazement.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Joanna whirled as I came into the room and visibly paled before,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Goodness, Race, I didn't know you!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,flashes and glints of color.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I gave the kid a grin before I realized that I was disguised anyhow and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"probably a hideous sight. The little boy backed off, but Joanna put her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Mickey toddled toward Juli, holding up the shining thing in his hands as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,if to display something very precious and beloved. Juli bent and held,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Please let me see,"" Juli coaxed, and he brought it out, slowly, still",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"suspicious. It was an angled prism of crystal, star-shaped, set in a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,frame which could get the star spinning like a solidopic. But it,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,displayed a new and comical face every time it was turned.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Mickey turned it round and round, charmed at being the center of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"attention. There seemed to be dozens of faces, shifting with each spin",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the prism, human and nonhuman, all dim and slightly distorted. My own",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"face, Juli's, Joanna's came out of the crystal surface, not a reflection",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,but a caricature.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A choked sound from Juli made me turn in dismay. She had let herself,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"drop to the floor and was sitting there, white as death, supporting",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I bent and shook her. ""What's the matter with you?"" I demanded. She had",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"lapsed into the dazed, sleepwalking horror of this morning. She",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"whispered, ""It's not a toy. Rindy had one. Joanna, _where did he get",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Race. I threw it out once, and she woke up and screamed. She shrieked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,for hours and hours and she ran out in the dark and dug for it in the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"trash pile, where I'd buried it. She went out in the dark, broke all her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"fingernails, but she dug it out again."" She checked herself, staring at",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Joanna, her eyes wide in appeal.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Well, dear,"" said Joanna with mild, rebuking kindness, ""you needn't be",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"so upset. I don't think Mickey's so attached to it as all that, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"anyhow I'm not going to throw it away."" She patted Juli reassuringly on",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Who knows? It might be a clue to something."" The toy had reminded me of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"something, too, and I tried to remember what it was. I'd seen nonhuman",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"toys in the Kharsa, even bought them for Mack's kids. When a single man",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"is invited frequently to a home with five youngsters, it's about the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"only way he can repay that hospitality, by bringing the children odd",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,trifles and knicknacks. But I had never seen anything quite like this,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"one, until--",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"--Until yesterday. The toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa, the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,a dozen of those prism-and-star sparklers.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I tried to call up a mental picture of the little toy-seller. I didn't,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,have much luck. I'd seen him only in that one swift glance from beneath,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"his hood. ""Juli, have you ever seen a little man, like a _chak_ only",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""It was just an idea."" But it was something to think about. A toy-seller",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had vanished. Rakhal, before disappearing, had smashed all Rindy's toys.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And the sight of a plaything of cunningly-cut crystal had sent Juli into,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,hysterics.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""I'd better go before it's too dark,"" I said. I buckled the final clasp",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of my shirtcloak, fitted my skean another notch into it, and counted the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"money Mack had advanced me for expenses. ""I want to get into the Kharsa",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Where else?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Juli turned, leaning one hand against the wall. She looked frail and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"ill, years older than she was. Suddenly she flung her thin arms around",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"me, and a link of the chain on her fettered hands struck me hard, as she",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"cried out, ""Race, Race, he'll kill you! How can I live with that on my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,arms firmly from my neck. A link of the chain caught on the clasp of my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shirtcloak, and again something snapped inside me. I grasped the chain",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in my two hands and gave a mighty heave, bracing my foot against the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,wall. The links snapped asunder. A flying end struck Juli under the eye.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I ripped at the seals of the jeweled cuffs, tore them from her arms,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"find threw the whole assembly into a corner, where it fell with a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,clash.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"It was getting dark when I slipped through a side gate, shabby and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"inconspicuous, into the spaceport square. Beyond the yellow lamps, I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,knew that the old city was beginning to take on life with the falling,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"night. Out of the chinked pebble-houses, men and woman, human and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"nonhuman, came forth into the moonlit streets.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"If anyone noticed me cross the square, which I doubted, they took me for",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"just another Dry-town vagabond, curious about the world of the strangers",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"from beyond the stars, and who, curiosity satisfied, was drifting back",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"where he belonged. I turned down one of the dark alleys that led away,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and soon was walking in the dark.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The Kharsa was not unfamiliar to me as a Terran, but for the last six",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,years I had seen only its daytime face. I doubted if there were a dozen,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Earthmen in the Old Town tonight, though I saw one in the bazaar, dirty",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and lurching drunk; one of those who run renegade and homeless between,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"worlds, belonging to neither. This was what I had nearly become.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I went further up the hill with the rising streets. Once I turned, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"saw below me the bright-lighted spaceport, the black many-windowed loom",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of the skyscraper like a patch of alien shadow in the red-violet,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,moonlight. I turned my back on them and walked on.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,At the fringe of the thieves market I paused outside a wineshop where,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dry-towners were made welcome. A golden nonhuman child murmured,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"something as she pattered by me in the street, and I stopped, gripped by",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,a spasm of stagefright. Had the dialect of Shainsa grown rusty on my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"tongue? Spies were given short shrift on Wolf, and a mile from the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"spaceport, I might as well have been on one of those moons. There were",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,no spaceport shockers at my back now. And someone might remember the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,tale of an Earthman with a scarred face who had gone to Shainsa in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,disguise....,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I shrugged the shirtcloak around my shoulders, pushed the door and went",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,in. I had remembered that Rakhal was waiting for me. Not beyond this,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"door, but at the end of the trail, behind some other door, somewhere.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And we have a byword in Shainsa: _A trail without beginning has no end_.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Right there I stopped thinking about Juli, Rindy, the Terran Empire, or",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"what Rakhal, who knew too many of Terra's secrets, might do if he had",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"turned renegade. My fingers went up and stroked, musingly, the ridge of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,scar tissue along my mouth. At that moment I was thinking only of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Rakhal, of an unsettled blood-feud, and of my revenge.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Red lamps were burning inside the wineshop, where men reclined on frowsy",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"couches. I stumbled over one of them, found an empty place and let",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"myself sink down on it, arranging myself automatically in the sprawl of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Dry-towners indoors. In public they stood, rigid and formal, even to eat",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and drink. Among themselves, anything less than a loose-limbed sprawl",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,betrayed insulting watchfulness; only a man who fears secret murder,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,keeps himself on guard.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A girl with a tangled rope of hair down her back came toward me. Her,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hands were unchained, meaning she was a woman of the lowest class, not",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,worth safeguarding. Her fur smock was shabby and matted with filth. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sent her for wine. When it came it was surprisingly good, the sweet and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"treacherous wine of Ardcarran. I sipped it slowly, looking round.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"If a caravan for Shainsa were leaving tomorrow, it would be known here.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"A word dropped that I was returning there would bring me, by ironbound",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"custom, an invitation to travel in their company.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"When I sent the woman for wine a second time, a man on a nearby couch",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"got up, and walked over to me.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He was tall even for a Dry-towner, and there was something vaguely",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"familiar about him. He was no riffraff of the Kharsa, either, for his",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shirtcloak was of rich silk interwoven with metallic threads, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,crusted with heavy embroideries. The hilt of his skean was carved from a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,single green gem. He stood looking down at me for some time before he,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,spoke.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""I never forget a voice, although I cannot bring your face to mind. Have",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I a duty toward you?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I had spoken a jargon to the girl, but he addressed me in the lilting,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sing-song speech of Shainsa. I made no answer, gesturing him to be",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"seated. On Wolf, formal courtesy requires a series of polite _non",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sequiturs_, and while a direct question merely borders on rudeness, a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,direct answer is the mark of a simpleton.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""A drink?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""I joined you unasked,"" he retorted, and summoned the tangle-headed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"girl. ""Bring us better wine than this swill!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,With that word and gesture I recognized him and my teeth clamped hard on,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,my lip. This was the loudmouth who had shown fight in the spaceport,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"cafe, and run away before the dark girl with the sign of Nebran sprawled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,on her breast.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,But in this poor light he had not recognized me. I moved deliberately,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,into the full red glow. If he did not know me for the Terran he had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"challenged last night in the spaceport cafe, it was unlikely that anyone",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"else would. He stared at me for some minutes, but in the end he only",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,shrugged and poured wine from the bottle he had ordered.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Three drinks later I knew that his name was Kyral and that he was a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,trader in wire and fine steel tools through the nonhuman towns. And I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had given him the name I had chosen, Rascar.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He asked, ""Are you thinking of returning to Shainsa?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Wary of a trap, I hesitated, but the question seemed harmless, so I only",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"countered, ""Have you been long in the Kharsa?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Several weeks.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Trading?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""No."" He applied himself to the wine again. ""I was searching for a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"member of my family.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Did you find him?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Her,"" said Kyral, and ceremoniously spat. ""No, I didn't find her. What",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"is your business in Shainsa?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I chuckled briefly. ""As a matter of fact, I am searching for a member of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"my family.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He narrowed his eyelids as if he suspected me of mocking him, but",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,personal privacy is the most rigid convention of the Dry-towns and such,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,mockery showed a sensible disregard for prying questions if I did not,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,choose to answer them. He questioned no further.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""I can use an extra man to handle the loads. Are you good with pack",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"caravan.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I agreed. Then, reflecting that Juli and Rakhal must, after all, be",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"known in Shainsa, I asked, ""Do you know a trader who calls himself",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Sensar?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He started slightly; I saw his eyes move along my scars. Then reserve,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"like a lowered curtain, shut itself over his face, concealing a brief",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"satisfied glimmer. ""No,"" he lied, and stood up.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""We leave at first daylight. Have your gear ready."" He flipped something",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"at me, and I caught it in midair. It was a stone incised with Kyral's",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"name in the ideographs of Shainsa. ""You can sleep with the caravan if",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"you care to. Show that token to Cuinn.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Kyral's caravan was encamped in a barred field past the furthest gates,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of the Kharsa. About a dozen men were busy loading the pack,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"animals--horses shipped in from Darkover, mostly. I asked the first man",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I met for Cuinn. He pointed out a burly fellow in a shiny red,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shirtcloak, who was busy at chewing out one of the young men for the way",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,he'd put a packsaddle on his beast.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Shainsa is a good language for cursing, but Cuinn had a special talent",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,at it. I blinked in admiration while I waited for him to get his breath,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,so I could hand him Kyral's token.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,In the light of the fire I saw what I'd half expected: he was the second,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of the Dry-towners who'd tried to rough me up in the spaceport cafe.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Cuinn barely glanced at the cut stone and tossed it back, pointing out",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"one of the packhorses. ""Load your personal gear on that one, then get",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"busy and show this mush-headed wearer of sandals""--an insult carrying",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"particularly filthy implications in Shainsa--""how to fasten a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"packstrap.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He drew breath and began to swear at the luckless youngster again, and I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"relaxed. He evidently hadn't recognized me, either. I took the strap in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"my hand, guiding it through the saddle loop. ""Like that,"" I told the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"kid, and Cuinn stopped swearing long enough to give me a curt nod of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,acknowledgment and point out a heap of boxed and crated objects.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Help him load up. We want to get clear of the city by daybreak,"" he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"ordered, and went off to swear at someone else.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral turned up at dawn, and a few minutes later the camp had vanished",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,into a small scattering of litter and we were on our way.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral's caravan, in spite of Cuinn's cursing, was well-managed and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"well-handled. The men were Dry-towners, eleven of them, silent and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"capable and most of them very young. They were cheerful on the trail,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"handled the pack animals competently, during the day, and spent most of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the nights grouped around the fire, gambling silently on the fall of the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,cut-crystal prisms they used for dice.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Three days out of the Kharsa I began to worry about Cuinn.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,It was of course a spectacular piece of bad luck to find all three of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the men from the spaceport cafe in Kyral's caravan. Kyral had obviously,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"not known me, and even by daylight he paid no attention to me except to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,give an occasional order. The second of the three was a gangling kid who,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"probably never gave me a second look, let alone a third.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"But Cuinn was another matter. He was a man my own age, and his fierce",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,eyes had a shrewdness in them that I did not trust. More than once I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"caught him watching me, and on the two or three occasions when he drew",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"me into conversation, I found his questions more direct than Dry-town",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,good manners allowed. I weighed the possibility that I might have to,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,kill him before we reached Shainsa.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,We crossed the foothills and began to climb upward toward the mountains.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The first few days I found myself short of breath as we worked upward,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"into thinner air, then my acclimatization returned and I began to fall",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,into the pattern of the days and nights on the trail. The Trade City,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was still a beacon in the night, but its glow on the horizon grew dimmer",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with each day's march.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Higher we climbed, along dangerous trails where men had to dismount and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"let the pack animals pick their way, foot by foot. Here in these",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"altitudes the sun at noonday blazed redder and brighter, and the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Dry-towners, who come from the parched lands in the sea-bottoms, were",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,burned and blistered by the fierce light. I had grown up under the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blazing sun of Terra, and a red sun like Wolf, even at its hottest,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,caused me no discomfort. This alone would have made me suspect. Once,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,again I found Cuinn's fierce eyes watching me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,As we crossed the passes and began to descend the long trail through the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"thick forests, we got into nonhuman country. Racing against the Ghost",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Wind, we skirted the country around Charin, and the woods inhabited by",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the terrible Ya-men, birdlike creatures who turn cannibal when the Ghost",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Wind blows.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Later the trail wound through thicker forests of indigo trees and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"grayish-purple brushwood, and at night we heard the howls of the catmen",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of these latitudes. At night we set guards about the caravan, and the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,dark spaces and shadows were filled with noises and queer smells and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rustlings.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Nevertheless, the day's marches and the night watches passed without",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,event until the night I shared guard with Cuinn. I had posted myself at,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the edge of the camp, the fire behind me. The men were sleeping rolls of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"snores, huddled close around the fire. The animals, hobbled with double",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"ropes, front feet to hind feet, shifted uneasily and let out long",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,uncanny whines.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I heard Cuinn pacing behind me. I heard a rustle at the edge of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"forest, a stir and whisper beyond the trees, and turned to speak to him,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,then saw him slipping away toward the outskirts of the clearing.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"For a moment I thought nothing of it, thinking that he was taking a few",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,steps toward the gap in the trees where he had disappeared. I suppose I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,had the idea that he had slipped away to investigate some noise or,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shadow, and that I should be at hand.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Then I saw the flicker of lights beyond the trees--light from the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,lantern Cuinn had been carrying in his hand! He was signaling!,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I slipped the safety clasp from the hilt of my skean and went after him.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,In the dimming glow of the fire I fancied I saw luminous eyes watching,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,desperately to force the blade away from my throat.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I gasped, ""Don't be a fool! One yell and the whole camp will be awake!",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Who were you signaling?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"In the light of the fallen lantern, lips drawn back in a snarl, he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"looked almost inhuman. He strained at the knife for a moment, then",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"dropped it. ""Let me up,"" he said.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I got up and kicked the fallen skean toward him. ""Put that away. What in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hell were you doing, trying to bring the catmen down on us?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"For a moment he looked taken aback, then his fierce face closed down",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"again and he said wrathfully, ""Can't a man walk away from the camp",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"without being half strangled?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I glared at him, but realized I really had nothing to go by. He might",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"have been answering a call of nature, and the movement of the lantern",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"accidental. And if someone had jumped me from behind, I might have",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"pulled a knife on him myself. So I only said, ""Don't do it again. We're",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"all too jumpy.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"while I lay huddled in my shirtcloak and blanket by the fire, I saw",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Cuinn slip out of his bedroll and steal away. A moment later there was a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"gleam in the darkness, but before I could summon the resolve to get up",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and face it out with him, he returned, looked cautiously at the snoring",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"While we were unpacking at the next camp, Kyral halted beside me. ""Heard",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,anything queer lately? I've got the notion we're being trailed. We'll be,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I debated speaking to him about Cuinn's signals. No, I had my own",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,private intrigue?,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He said, ""I'm putting you and Cuinn on watch again. The old men doze",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"You don't have one by any chance?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"After the men had turned in, Cuinn patrolling the camp, halted a minute",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,beside me and cocked his head toward the rustling forest.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""What's going on in there?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""We'd fight."" Then I sucked in my breath, for Cuinn had spoken Terran",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""A trader,"" I said, ""who pays my wages and minds his own affairs."" I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Kyral told me you'd been asking questions about Rakhal Sensar,"" he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"muttered, ""If you've brought them down on us--""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,He never finished the sentence. Just behind us came another of the long,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"eerie howls. I knocked Cuinn away, and suddenly the night was filled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with crouching forms that came down on us like a whirlwind.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I shouted madly as the camp came alive with men struggling out of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blankets, fighting for life itself. I ran hard, still shouting, for the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"enclosure where we had tied the horses. A catman, slim and black-furred,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,was crouched and cutting the hobble-strings of the nearest animal. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hurled myself on him. He exploded, clawing, raking my shoulder with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,talons that ripped the rough cloth like paper. I whipped out my skean,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and slashed upward. The talons contracted in my shoulder and I gasped,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"with pain. Then the thing howled and fell away, clawing at the air. It",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,twitched and lay still.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Four shots in rapid succession cracked in the clearing. Kyral to the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"contrary, someone must have had a pistol. I heard one of the cat-things",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wail, a hoarse dying rattle. Something dark clawed my arm and I slashed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"with the knife, going down as another set of talons fastened in my back,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rolling and clutching.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I managed to get the thing's forelimbs wedged under my elbow, my knee in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,wail.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then I felt the spine snap and the dead thing mewled once, just air",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"escaping from collapsing lungs, and slid limp from my thigh. Erect it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,had not been over four feet tall and in the light of the dying fire it,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,might have been a dead lynx.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Rascar...."" I heard a gasp, a groan. I whirled and saw Kyral go down,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"struggling, drowning in half a dozen or more of the fierce half-humans.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I leaped at the smother of bodies, ripped one away with a stranglehold,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,slashed at its throat.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,They were easy to kill.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I heard a high, urgent scream in their mewing tongue. Then the furred",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,black things seemed to melt into the forest as silently as they had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"come. Kyral, dazed, his forehead running blood, his arm slashed to the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"bone, was sitting on the ground, still stunned.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Somebody had to take charge. I bellowed, ""Lights! Get lights. They won't",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"come back if we have enough light, they can only see well in the dark.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Someone stirred the fire. It blazed up as they piled on dead branches,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and I roughly commanded one of the kids to fill every lantern he could,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"find, and get them burning. Four of the dead things were lying in the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"clearing. The youngster I'd helped loading horses, the first day, gazed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"down at one of the catmen, half-disemboweled by somebody's skean, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"suddenly bolted for the bushes, where I heard him retching.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I set the others with stronger stomachs to dragging the bodies away from,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the clearing, and went back to see how badly Kyral was hurt. He had the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rip in his arm and his face was covered with blood from a shallow scalp,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wound, but he insisted on getting up to inspect the hurts of the others.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"There was no one without a claw-wound in leg or back or shoulder, but",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"none were serious, and we were all feeling fairly cheerful when someone",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"demanded, ""Where's Cuinn?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He didn't seem to be anywhere. Kyral, staggering slightly, insisted on",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"searching, but I felt we wouldn't find him. ""He probably went off with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"his friends,"" I snorted, and told about the signaling. Kyral looked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,grave.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""You should have told me,"" he began, but shouts from the far end of the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"clearing sent us racing there. We nearly stumbled over a single,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"solitary, motionless form, outstretched and lifeless, blind eyes staring",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,upward at the moons.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Once we were free of the forest, the road to the Dry-towns lay straight",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"before us, with no hidden dangers. Some of us limped for a day or two,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"or favored an arm or leg clawed by the catmen, but I knew that what",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Kyral said was true; it was a lucky caravan which had to fight off only,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,one attack.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Cuinn haunted me. A night or two of turning over his cryptic words in my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"mind had convinced me that whoever, or whatever he'd been signaling, it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wasn't the catmen. And his urgent question ""Where's the girl?"" swam",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"endlessly in my brain, making no more sense than when I had first heard",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,it. Who had he mistaken me for? What did he think I was mixed up in? And,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"who, above all, were the ""others"" who had to be signaled, at the risk of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,an attack by catmen which had meant his own death?,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"With Cuinn dead, and Kyral thinking I'd saved his life, a large part of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the responsibility for the caravan now fell on me. And strangely I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"enjoyed it, making the most of this interval when I was separated from",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the thought of blood-feud or revenge, the need of spying or the threat",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of exposure. During those days and nights on the trail I grew back,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,slowly into the Dry-towner I once had been. I knew I would be sorry when,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the walls of Shainsa rose on the horizon, bringing me back inescapably",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to my own quest.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"We swung wide, leaving the straight trail to Shainsa, and Kyral",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"announced his intention of stopping for half a day at Canarsa, one of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the walled nonhuman cities which lay well off the traveled road. To my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"inadvertent show of surprise, he returned that he had trading",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,connections there.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""We all need a day's rest, and the Silent Ones will buy from me, though",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,have lenses? You can get a better price in Canarsa than you'd get in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Kyral had been most friendly since the night I had dug him out from,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"under the catmen, and I knew no way to refuse without exposing myself",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,for the sham trader I was. But I was deathly apprehensive. Even with,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Rakhal I had never entered any of the nonhuman towns.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"On Wolf, human and nonhuman have lived side by side for centuries. And",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the human is not always the superior being. I might pass, among the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Dry-towners and the relatively stupid humanoid _chaks_, for another",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dry-towner. But Rakhal had cautioned me I could not pass among nonhumans,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"for native Wolfan, and warned me against trying.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Nevertheless, I accompanied Kyral, carrying the box which had cost about",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,a week's pay in the Terran Zone and was worth a small fortune in the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dry-towns.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Canarsa seemed, inside the gates, like any other town. The houses were",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"round, beehive fashion, and the streets totally empty. Just inside the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"gates a hooded figure greeted us, and gestured us by signs to follow",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,him. He was covered from head to foot with some coarse and shiny fiber,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,woven into stuff that looked like sacking.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,But under the thick hooding was horror. It slithered and it had nothing,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"like a recognizable human shape or walk, and I felt the primeval ape in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"me cowering and gibbering in a corner of my brain. Kyral muttered, close",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"to my ear, ""No outsider is ever allowed to look on the Silent Ones in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"their real form. I think they're deaf and dumb, but be damn careful.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""You bet,"" I whispered, and was glad the streets were empty. I walked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"along, trying not to look at the gliding motion of that shrouded thing",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,up ahead.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The trading was done in an open hut of reeds which looked as if it had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"been built in a hurry, and was not square, round, hexagonal or any other",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"recognizable geometrical shape. It formed a pattern of its own,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"presumably, but my human eyes couldn't see it. Kyral said in a breath of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"a whisper, ""They'll tear it down and burn it after we leave. We're",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,supposed to have contaminated it too greatly for any of the Silent Ones,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"ever to enter again. My family has traded with them for centuries, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"we're almost the only ones who have ever entered the city.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then two of the Silent Ones of Canarsa, also covered with that coarse",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"shiny stuff, slithered into the hut, and Kyral choked off his words as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,if he had swallowed them.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,It was the strangest trading I had ever done. Kyral laid out the small,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"forged-steel tools and the coils of thin fine wire, and I unpacked my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,lenses and laid them out in neat rows. The Silent Ones neither spoke nor,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"moved, but through a thin place in the gray veiling I saw a speck which",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"might have been a phosphorescent eye, moving back and forth as if",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then I smothered a gasp, for suddenly blank spaces appeared in the rows",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of merchandise. Certain small tools--wirecutters, calipers, surgical",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"scissors--had vanished, and all the coils of wire had disappeared.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Blanks equally had appeared in the rows of lenses; all of my tiny,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"powerful microscope lenses had vanished. I cast a quick glance at Kyral,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"but he seemed unsurprised. I recalled vague rumors of the Silent Ones,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and concluded that, eerie though it seemed, this was merely their way of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,doing business.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral pointed at one of the tools, at an exceptionally fine pair of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"binocular lenses, at the last of the coils of wire. The shrouded ones",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"did not move, but the lenses and the wire vanished. The small tool",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"remained, and after a moment Kyral dropped his hand.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I took my cue from Kyral and remained motionless, awaiting whatever",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,surprise was coming. I had halfway expected what happened next. In the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blank spaces, little points of light began to glimmer, and after a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"moment, blue and red and green gem-stones appeared there. To me the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"substitution appeared roughly equitable and fair, though I am no judge",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of the fine points of gems.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral scowled slightly and pointed to one of the green gems, and after a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,moment it whisked away and a blue one took its place. In another spot,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"where a fine set of surgical instruments had lain, Kyral pointed at the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blue gem which now lay there, shook his head and held out three fingers.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"After a moment, a second blue stone lay winking beside the first.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral did not move, but inexorably held out the three fingers. There was",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"a little swirling in the air, and then both gems vanished, and the case",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of surgical instruments lay in their place.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Still Kyral did not move, but held the three fingers out for a full",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,minute. Finally he dropped them and bent to pick up the case,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"instruments. Again the little swirl in the air, and the instruments",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,vanished. In their place lay three of the blue gems. My mouth twitched,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,in the first amusement I had felt since we entered this uncanny place.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Evidently bargaining with the Silent Ones was not a great deal different,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"than bargaining with anyone anywhere. Nevertheless, under the eyes of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"those shrouded but horrible forms--if they had eyes, which I doubted--I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,had no impulse to protest their offered prices.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I gathered up the rejected lenses, repacked them neatly, and helped",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Kyral recrate the tools and instruments the Silent Ones had not wanted.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I noticed that in addition to the microscope lenses and surgical,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"instruments, they had taken all the fine wire. I couldn't imagine, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"didn't particularly want to imagine, what they intended to do with it.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"On our way back through the streets, unshepherded this time, Kyral's",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"tongue was loosened as if with a great release from tension. ""They're",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"psychokinetics,"" he told me. ""Quite a few of the nonhuman races are. I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"guess they have to be, having no eyes and no hands. But sometimes I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""What do you mean?"" I asked, not really listening. I was thinking mostly",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,about the way the small objects had melted away and reappeared. The,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sight had stirred some uncomfortable memory, a vague sense of danger. It",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was not tangible enough for me to know why I feared it, but just a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"subliminal uneasiness that kept prodding at me, like a tooth that isn't",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,quite aching yet.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral said, ""We of Shainsa live between fire and flood. Terra on the one",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hand, and on the other maybe something worse, who knows? We know so",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"little about the Silent Ones, and those like them. Who knows, maybe",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"we're giving them the weapons to destroy us--"" He broke off, with a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"gasp, and stood staring down one of the streets.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"It lay open and bare between two rows of round houses, and Kyral was",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,staring fixedly at a doorway which had opened there. I followed his,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"paralyzed gaze, and saw the girl.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Hair like spun black glass fell in hard waves around her shoulders, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the red eyes smiled with alien malice, alien mischief, beneath the dark",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,crown of little stars. And the Toad God sprawled in hideous,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,embroideries across the white folds of her breast.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Kyral gulped hoarsely. His hand flew up as he clutched the charms strung,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"about his neck. I imitated the gesture mechanically, watching Kyral,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,wondering if he would turn and run again. But he stood frozen for a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"minute. Then the spell broke and he took one step toward the girl, arms",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,outstretched.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Miellyn!"" he cried, and there was heartbreak in his voice. And again,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,This time it was the girl who whirled and fled. Her white robes,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,fluttered and I saw the twinkle of her flying feet as she vanished into,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,a space between the houses and was gone.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Kyral took one blind step down the street, then another. But before he",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"could burst into a run I had him by the arm, dragging him back to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,sanity.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Man, you've gone mad! Chase, in a nonhuman town?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He struggled for a minute, then, with a harsh sigh, he said, ""It's all",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"right, I won't--"" and shook loose from my arm.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,He did not speak again until we reached the gates of Canarsa and they,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"closed, silently and untouched, behind us. I had forgotten the place",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"already. I had space only to think of the girl, whose face I had not",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,forgotten since the moment when she saved me and disappeared. Now she,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,had appeared again to Kyral. What did it all mean?,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I asked, as we walked toward the camp, ""Do you know that girl?"" But I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"knew the question was futile. Kyral's face was closed, conceding",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"nothing, and his friendliness had vanished completely.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He said, ""Now I know you. You saved me from the catmen, and again in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"dealings with those who have been touched by the Toad God."" He spat",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Shainsa, first in the chain of Dry-towns that lie in the bed of a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"long-dried ocean, is set at the center of a great alkali plain; a dusty,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"parched city bleached by a million years of sun. The houses are high,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,spreading buildings with many rooms and wide windows. The poorer sort,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"were made of sun-dried brick, the more imposing being cut from the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,bleached salt stone of the cliffs that rise behind the city.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"News travels fast in the Dry-towns. If Rakhal were in the city, he'd",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"soon know that I was here, and guess who I was or why I'd come. I might",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"disguise myself so that my own sister, or the mother who bore me, would",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,not know me. But I had no illusions about my ability to disguise myself,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,from Rakhal. He had created the disguise that was me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"When the second sun set, red and burning, behind the salt cliffs, I knew",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"he was not in Shainsa, but I stayed on, waiting for something to happen.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"At night I slept in a cubbyhole behind a wineshop, paying an inordinate",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,price for that very dubious privilege. And every day in the sleepy,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,silence of the blood-red noon I paced the public square of Shainsa.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,This went on for four days. No one took the slightest notice of another,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"nameless man in a shabby shirtcloak, without name or identity or known",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"business. No one appeared to see me except the dusty children, with pale",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"fleecy hair, who played their patient games on the windswept curbing of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the square. They surveyed my scarred face with neither curiosity or,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"fear, and it occurred to me that Rindy might be such another as these.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"If I had still been thinking like an Earthman, I might have tried to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"question one of the children, or win their confidence. But I had a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,deeper game in hand.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,On the fifth day I was so much a fixture that my pacing went unnoticed,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"even by the children. On the gray moss of the square, a few",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"dried-looking old men, their faces as faded as their shirtcloaks and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"bearing the knife scars of a hundred forgotten fights, drowsed on the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stone benches. And along the flagged walk at the edge of the square, as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"suddenly as an autumn storm in the salt flats, a woman came walking.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She was tall, with a proud swinging walk, and a metallic clashing kept",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"rhythm to her swift steps. Her arms were fettered, each wrist bound with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"a jeweled bracelet and the bracelets linked together by a long,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,silver-gilt chain passed through a silken loop at her waist. From the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"loop swung a tiny golden padlock, but in the lock stood an even tinier",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"key, signifying that she was a higher caste than her husband or consort,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,that her fettering was by choice and not command.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,She stopped directly before me and raised her arm in formal greeting,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,like a man. The chain made a tinkling sound in the hushed square as her,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,other hand was pulled up tight against the silken loop at her waist. She,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stood surveying me for some moments, and finally I raised my head and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,returned her gaze. I don't know why I had expected her to have hair like,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,spun black glass and eyes that burned with a red reflection of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,burning star.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,This woman's eyes were darker than the poison-berries of the salt,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"cliffs, and her mouth was a cut berry that looked just as dangerous. She",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was young, the slimness of her shoulders and the narrow steel-chained",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wrists told me how very young she was, but her face had seen weather and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"storms, and her dark eyes had weathered worse psychic storms than that.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She did not flinch at the sight of my scars, and met my gaze without",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,dropping her eyes.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""You are a stranger. What is your business in Shainsa?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I met the direct question with the insolence it demanded, hardly moving",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"my lips. ""I have come to buy women for the brothels of Ardcarran.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Perhaps when washed you might be suitable. Who could arrange for your,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sale?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She took the rebuke impassively, though the bitter crimson of her mouth",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,twitched a little in mischief or rage. But she made no sign. The battle,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was joined between us, and I knew already that it would be fought to the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,end.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"From somewhere in her draperies, something fell to the ground with a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,little tinkle. But I knew that trick too and I did not move. Finally she,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,went away without bending to retrieve it and when I looked around I saw,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"that all the fleece-haired children had stolen away, leaving their",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,playthings lying on the curbing. But one or two of the gaffers on the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stone benches, who were old enough to show curiosity without losing",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"face, were watching me with impassive eyes.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I could have asked the woman's name then, but I held back, knowing it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,could only lessen the prestige I had gained from the encounter. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"glanced down, without seeming to do so, at the tiny mirror which had",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,fallen from the recesses of the fur robe. Her name might have been,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,inscribed on the reverse.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,But I left it lying there to be picked up by the children when they,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"returned, and went back to the wineshop. I had accomplished my first",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"objective; if you can't be inconspicuous, be so damned conspicuous that",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,nobody can miss you. And that in itself is a fair concealment. How many,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,people can accurately describe a street riot?,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I was finishing off a bad meal with a stone bottle of worse wine when,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the _chak_ came in, disregarding the proprietor, and made straight for",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,me. He was furred immaculately white. His velvet muzzle was contracted,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"as if the very smells might soil it, and he kept a dainty paw",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,outstretched to ward off accidental contact with greasy counters or,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"tables or tapestries. His fur was scented, and his throat circled with a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,collar of embroidered silk. This pampered minion surveyed me with the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,innocent malice of an uninvolved nonhuman for merely human intrigues.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I came, with no more than polite protest, but was startled. I had not",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,expected the encounter to reach the Great House so soon. Shainsa's Great,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,House had changed hands four times since I had last been in Shainsa. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,wasn't overly anxious to appear there.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The white _chak_, as out of place in the rough Dry-town as a jewel in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the streets or a raindrop in the desert, led me along a winding",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,boulevard to an outlying district. He made no attempt to engage me in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"conversation, and indeed I got the distinct impression that this",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,cockscomb of a nonhuman considered me well beneath his notice. He seemed,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"much more aware of the blowing dust in the street, which ruffled and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"The Great House was carved from blocks of rough pink basalt, the entry",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"guarded by two great caryatids enwrapped in chains of carved metal, set",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,somehow into the surface of the basalt. The gilt had long ago worn away,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,from the chains so that it alternately gleamed gold or smudged base,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"upright inside it, was my first impression, but I dismissed that thought",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,quickly; any Terran thought was apt to betray me. But the main hall was,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"built on a scale even more huge, and it was even colder than the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"When I came to again I was lying with my head in Dallisa's lap, and the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,reddish color of sunset was in the room. Her thighs were soft under my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"head, and for an instant I wondered if, in delirium, I had conceded to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Can you swallow this?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I could and did. I couldn't taste it yet, but it was cold and wet and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,felt heavenly trickling down my throat. She bent and looked into my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"eyes, and I felt as if I were falling into those reddish and stormy",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,depths. She touched my scarred mouth with a light finger. Suddenly my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,head cleared and I sat upright.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Is this a trick to force me into calling my bet?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"She recoiled as if I had struck her, then the trace of a smile flitted",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"around her red mouth. Yes, between us it was battle. ""You are right to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"be suspicious, I suppose. But if I tell you what I know of Rakhal, will",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I looked straight at her and said, ""No.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Surprisingly, she threw back her head and laughed. I flexed my freed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wrists cautiously. The skin was torn away and chafed, and my arms ached",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to the bone. When I moved harsh lances of pain drove through my chest.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Well, until sunset I have no right to ask you to trust me,"" said",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Is that my privilege? Do you refuse?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Refuse?"" It was not yet sunset. This might be a torture more complex",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,than any which had yet greeted me. From the scarlet glint in her eyes I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"felt she was playing with me, as the cat-things of the forest play with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,their helpless victims. My mouth twitched in a grimace of humiliation as,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I lowered myself obediently until my head rested on her fur-clad knees.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She murmured, smiling, ""Is this so unbearable, then?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I said nothing. Never, never for an instant could I forget that--all",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"human, all woman as she seemed--Dallisa's race was worn and old when the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Terran Empire had not left their home star. The mind of Wolf, which has",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"mingled with the nonhuman since before the beginnings of recorded time,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,is unfathomable to an outsider. I was better equipped than most Earthmen,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"to keep pace with its surface acts, but I could never pretend to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,understand its deeper motivations.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,It works on complex and irrational logic. Mischief is an integral part,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,of it. Even the deadly blood-feud with Rakhal had begun with an,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"overelaborate practical joke--which had lost the Service, incidentally,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,several thousand credits worth of spaceship.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And so I could not trust Dallisa for an instant. Yet it was wonderful to,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,lie here with my head resting against the perfumed softness of her body.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then suddenly her arms were gripping me, frantic and hungry; the subdued",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"thing in her voice, her eyes, flamed out hot and wild. She was pressing",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the whole length of her body to mine, breasts and thighs and long legs,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and her voice was hoarse.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Is this torture too?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Beneath the fur robe she was soft and white, and the subtle scent of her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"hair seemed a deeper entrapment than any. Frail as she seemed, her arms",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had the strength of steel, and pain blazed down my wrenched shoulders,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,seared through the twisted wrists. Then I forgot the pain.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Over her shoulder the last dropping redness of the sun vanished and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,plunged the room into orchid twilight.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I caught her wrists in my hands, prizing them backward, twisting them",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,stopped her wild mouth with mine.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And I knew that the battle between us had reached climax and victory,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"During the night sometime, while her dark head lay motionless on my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,throbbing of my bruises had little to do with my sleeplessness; I was,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"remembering other chained girls from the old days in the Dry-towns, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the honey and poison of them distilled into Dallisa's kisses. Her head,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was very light on my shoulders, and she felt curiously insubstantial,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,like a woman of feathers.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,a pinpoint. Rakhal was in Charin.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I wasn't altogether surprised. Charin is the only city on Wolf, except",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the Kharsa, where the Terran Empire has put down deep roots into the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"planet, built a Trade City, a smaller spaceport. Like the Kharsa, it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,lies within the circle of Terran law--and a million miles outside it.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"A nonhuman town, inhabited largely by _chaks_, it is the core and center",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the resistance movement, a noisy town in a perpetual ferment. It was",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the logical place for a renegade. I settled myself so that the ache in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Slight as the movement was, it roused Dallisa. She rolled over and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"hunters?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dallisa didn't answer. I hadn't expected her to answer. I asked the real,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"question in my mind: ""Why does Kyral hate Rakhal Sensar, when he doesn't",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Dry-towns, are based on expediency and suspicion, and are frequently,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"though not always loveless. It explained Dallisa's taunts, and it partly",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"explained, only partly, why I found her in my arms. It did not explain",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Rakhal's part in this mysterious intrigue, nor why Kyral had taken me",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"for Rakhal, (but only after he remembered seeing me in Terran clothing).",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I wondered why it had never occurred to me before that I might be,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"mistaken for Rakhal. There was no close resemblance between us, but a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,casual description would apply equally well to me or to Rakhal. My,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,height is unusual for a Terran--within an inch of Rakhal's own--and we,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had roughly the same build, the same coloring. I had copied his walk,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"_kifirgh_ on my mouth, cheeks, and shoulders. Anyone who did not know us",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"by sight, anyone who had known us by reputation from the days when we",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had worked together in the Dry-towns, might easily take one of us for",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the other. Even Juli had blurted, ""You're so much like--"" before",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,thinking better of it.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Other odd bits of the puzzle floated in my mind, stubbornly refusing to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"take on recognizable patterns, the disappearance of a toy-seller; Juli's",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,hysterical babbling; the way the girl--Miellyn?--had vanished into a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,shrine of Nebran; and the taunts of Dallisa and the old man about a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"mysterious ""Toymaker."" And something, some random joggling of a memory,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,in that eerie trading in the city of the Silent Ones. I knew all these,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"things fitted together somehow, but I had no real hope that Dallisa",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,could complete their pattern for me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She said, with a vehemence that startled me, ""Miellyn is only the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"he'll fight!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,She rolled over and pressed herself against me in the darkness. Her,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"And there are other things, worse things.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I sat up, surprised to find myself defending Terra to this girl. After",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,all these years I was back in my own world. And yet I heard myself say,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"quietly, ""The Terrans aren't exploiting Wolf. We haven't abolished the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"rule of Shainsa. We've changed nothing.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"It was true. Terra held Wolf by compact, not conquest. They paid, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"paid generously, for the lease of the lands where their Trade Cities",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,The people themselves get tired of living under feudal or theocratic,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""But that's just it,"" Dallisa argued. ""You give the people all those",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"things we used to give them, and you do it better. Just by being here,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I put my hand under her chin, and looked down gravely into her face,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,only a pale oval in the darkness. There was nothing I could say; she had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"said it all, and truthfully. I had hated and yearned and starved for",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"this, and when I found it, it turned salty and bloody on my lips, like",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Dallisa's despairing kisses. She ran her fingers over the scars on my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"face, then gripped her small thin hands around my wrists so fiercely",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,that I grunted protest.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""You will not forget me,"" she said in her strangely lilting voice. ""You",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"will not forget me, although you were victorious."" She twisted and lay",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"looking up at me, her eyes glowing faintly luminous in darkness. I knew",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,out a stifled cry of dismay. And then I tossed the chains into a corner,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,before I drew her savagely into my arms again and forced her head back,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,under my mouth.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Race, take me with you!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,For answer I only picked up her narrow wrists and turned them over on my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,palm. The jeweled bracelets were clasped again around the thinly boned,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"joints, and on some self-punishing impulse she had shortened the chains",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,so that she could not even put her arms around me. I lifted the punished,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,wrists to my mouth and kissed them gently.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A few days later I found myself nearing the end of the trail.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"It was twilight in Charin, hot and reeking with the gypsy glare of fires",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"which burned, smoking, at the far end of the Street of the Six",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Shepherds. I crouched in the shadow of a wall, waiting.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,My skin itched from the dirty shirtcloak I hadn't changed in days.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Shabbiness is wise in nonhuman parts, and Dry-towners think too much of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,water to waste much of it in superfluous washing anyhow. I scratched,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,unobtrusively and glanced cautiously down the street.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"It seemed empty, except for a few sodden derelicts sprawled in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,doorways--the Street of the Six Shepherds is a filthy slum--but I made,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sure my skean was loose. Charin is not a particularly safe town, even",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"for Dry-towners, and especially not for Earthmen, at any time.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Even with what Dallisa had told me, the search had been difficult.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Charin is not Shainsa. In Charin, where human and nonhuman live closer",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"together than anywhere else on the planet, information about such men as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Rakhal can be bought, but the policy is to let the buyer beware. That's",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"fair enough, because the life of the seller has a way of not being worth",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"much afterward, either.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"A dirty, dust-laden wind was blowing up along the street, heavy with",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,strange smells. The pungent reek of incense from a street-shrine was in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the smells. The heavy, acrid odor that made my skin crawl. In the hills",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"behind Charin, the Ghost Wind was rising.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Borne on this wind, the Ya-men would sweep down from the mountains, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,everything human or nearly human would scatter in their path. They would,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"range through the quarter all night, and in the morning they would melt",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"away, until the Ghost Wind blew again. At any other time, I would",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"already have taken cover. I fancied that I could hear, borne on the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"wind, the faraway yelping, and envision the plumed, taloned figures",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,which would come leaping down the street.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"In that moment, the quiet of the street split asunder.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,From somewhere a girl's voice screamed in shrill pain or panic. Then I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"saw her, dodging between two of the chinked pebble-houses. She was a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"child, thin and barefoot, a long tangle of black hair flying loose as",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,she darted and twisted to elude the lumbering fellow at her heels. His,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,outstretched paw jerked cruelly at her slim wrist.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The little girl screamed and wrenched herself free and threw herself,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"straight on me, wrapping herself around my neck with the violence of a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,storm wind. Her hair got in my mouth and her small hands gripped at my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,back like a cat's flexed claws.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Oh, help me,"" she gasped between sobs. ""Don't let him get me, don't.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And even in that broken plea I took it in that the little ragamuffin did,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"not speak the jargon of that slum, but the pure speech of Shainsa.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,What I did then was as automatic as if it had been Juli. I pulled the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"kid loose, shoved her behind me, and scowled at the brute who lurched",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,toward us.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Make yourself scarce,"" I advised. ""We don't chase little girls where I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"come from. Haul off, now.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The man reeled. I smelled the rankness of his rags as he thrust one,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"grimy paw at the girl. I never was the hero type, but I'd started",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,something which I had to carry through. I thrust myself between them and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,put my hand on the skean again.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""You--you Dry-towner."" The man set up a tipsy howl, and I sucked in my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"breath. Now I was in for it. Unless I got out of there damned fast, I'd",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,lose what I'd come all the way to Charin to find.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I felt like handing the girl over. For all I knew, the bully could be",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,her father and she was properly in line for a spanking. This wasn't any,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of my business. My business lay at the end of the street, where Rakhal",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,was waiting at the fires. He wouldn't be there long. Already the smell,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the Ghost Wind was heavy and harsh, and little flurries of sand went",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"racing along the street, lifting the flaps of the doorways.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"But I did nothing so sensible. The big lunk made a grab at the girl, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I whipped out my skean and pantomimed.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Get going!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Dry-towner!"" He spat out the word like filth, his pig-eyes narrowing to",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"slits. ""Son of the Ape! _Earthman!_""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""_Terranan!_"" Someone took up the howl. There was a stir, a rustle, all",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"along the street that had seemed empty, and from nowhere, it seemed, the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"space in front of me was crowded with shadowy forms, human and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,otherwise.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Earthman!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I felt the muscles across my belly knotting into a band of ice. I didn't,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,believe I'd given myself away as an Earthman. The bully was using the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"time-dishonored tactic of stirring up a riot in a hurry, but just the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"same I looked quickly round, hunting a path of escape.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Put your skean in his guts, Spilkar! Grab him!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Hai-ai! Earthman! _Hai-ai!_""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,It was the last cry that made me panic. Through the sultry glare at the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"end of the street, I could see the plumed, taloned figures of the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Ya-men, gliding through the banners of smoke. The crowd melted open.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I didn't stop to reflect on the fact--suddenly very obvious--that Rakhal,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"couldn't have been at the fires at all, and that my informant had led me",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"into an open trap, a nest of Ya-men already inside Charin. The crowd",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"edged back and muttered, and suddenly I made my choice. I whirled,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,snatched up the girl in my arms and ran straight toward the advancing,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,figures of the Ya-men.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Nobody followed me. I even heard a choked shout that sounded like a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"warning. I heard the yelping shrieks of the Ya-men grow to a wild howl,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and at the last minute, when their stiff rustling plumes loomed only a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"few yards away, I dived sidewise into an alley, stumbled on some rubbish",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and spilled the girl down.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Run, kid!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,She shook herself like a puppy climbing out of water. Her small fingers,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"closed like a steel trap on my wrist. ""This way,"" she urged in a hasty",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"whisper, and I found myself plunging out the far end of the alley and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,into the shelter of a street-shrine. The sour stink of incense smarted,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in my nostrils, and I could hear the yelping of the Ya-men as they",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"leaped and rustled down the alley, their cold and poisonous eyes",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,searching out the recess where I crouched with the girl.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Here,"" she panted, ""stand close to me on the stone--"" I drew back,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The girl's arms flung round me again. I felt her slight, hard body",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,pressing on mine and she literally hauled me toward the pattern of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,hadn't caught her closer yet.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The world reeled. The street disappeared in a cone of spinning lights,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stars danced crazily, and I plunged down through a widening gulf of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,heels through tilting lights and shadows that flung us through,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,eternities of freefall. The yelping of the Ya-men whirled away in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"unimaginable distances, and for a second I felt the unmerciful blackout",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"An hour before dawn there was a noise in my room. I roused, my hand on",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"breathing, and grappled with it in the darkness. A foul-smelling",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,something gripped over my mouth. I tore it away and struck hard with the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,The _chak_ who ran the place came and gibbered at me. _Chaks_ have a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,horror of blood and this one gave me to understand that my lease was up,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"then and there, no arguments, no refunds. He wouldn't even let me go",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,gathered my few belongings together and strode out of the room. He would,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,not touch the coins I offered; I laid them on a chest and he let them,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The small lump of the bird in my pocket tantalized me. I took it out,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,After a while I noticed the proprietors of the shop staring at the silk,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the wrappings. They backed off, apprehensive. I held out a coin and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"they shook their heads. ""You are welcome to the drink,"" one of them",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,They would not touch the coins I offered. I thrust the bird in my,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"At first it was a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, a head seen too",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I stumbled over steps, took a jolting stride downward, and found myself",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in a dim room jammed with dark figures, human and nonhuman.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The figures swayed in the darkness, chanting in a dialect not altogether",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"familiar to me, a monotonous wailing chant, with a single recurrent",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"phrase: ""Kamaina! Kama-aina!"" It began on a high note, descending in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,weird chromatics to the lowest tone the human ear could resolve.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The sound made me draw back. Even the Dry-towners shunned the orgiastic,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rituals of Kamaina. Earthmen have a reputation for getting rid of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,more objectionable customs--by human standards--on any planet where they,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"live. But they don't touch religions, and Kamaina, on the surface",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"anyhow, was a religion.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I started to turn round and leave, as if I had inadvertently walked",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"through the wrong door, but my conductor hauled on my arm, and I was",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,wedged in too tight by now to risk a roughhouse. Trying to force my way,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"out would only have called attention to me, and the first of the Secret",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,other guy.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"As my eyes adapted to the dim light, I saw that most of the crowd were",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Charin plainsmen or _chaks_. One or two wore Dry-town shirtcloaks, and I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"even thought I saw an Earthman in the crowd, though I was never sure and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I fervently hope not. They were squatting around small crescent-shaped,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"tables, and all intently gazing at a flickery spot of light at the front",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the cellar. I saw an empty place at one table and dropped there,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"finding the floor soft, as if cushioned.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"On each table, small smudging pastilles were burning, and from these",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"cones of ash-tipped fire came the steamy, swimmy smoke that filled the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,darkness with strange colors. Beside me an immature _chak_ girl was,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"kneeling, her fettered hands strained tightly back at her sides, her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,naked breasts pierced for jeweled rings.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Beneath the pallid fur around her pointed ears, the exquisite animal",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"face was quite mad. She whispered to me, but her dialect was so thick",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"that I could follow only a few words, and would just as soon not have",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"heard those few. An older _chak_ grunted for silence and she subsided,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,swaying and crooning.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"There were cups and decanters on all the tables, and a woman tilted",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"pale, phosphorescent fluid into a cup and offered it to me. I took one",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sip, then another. It was cold and pleasantly tart, and not until the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,second swallow turned sweet on my tongue did I know what I tasted. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"pretended to swallow while the woman's eyes were fixed on me, then",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,somehow contrived to spill the filthy stuff down my shirt.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I was wary even of the fumes, but there was nothing else I could do. The",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stuff was _shallavan_, outlawed on every planet in the Terran Empire and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,every halfway decent planet outside it.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"More and more figures, men and creatures, kept crowding into the cellar,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,which was not very large. The place looked like the worst nightmare of a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"drug-dreamer, ablaze with the colors of the smoking incense, the swaying",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"crowd, and their monotonous cries. Quite suddenly there was a blaze of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"purple light and someone screamed in raving ecstasy: ""_Na ki na Nebran",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"n'hai Kamaina!_""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena!"" shrilled the tranced mob.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,An old man jumped up and started haranguing the crowd. I could just,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,follow his dialect. He was talking about Terra. He was talking about,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,riots. He was jabbering mystical gibberish which I couldn't understand,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and didn't want to understand, and rabble-rousing anti-Terran propaganda",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,which I understood much too well.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Another blaze of lights and another long scream in chorus:,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Evarin stood in the blaze of the many-colored light.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The Toymaker, as I had seen him last, cat-smooth, gracefully alien,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,shrouded in a ripple of giddy crimsons. Behind him was a blackness. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"waited till the painful blaze of lights abated, then, straining my eyes",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"to see past him, I got my worst shock.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"A woman stood there, naked to the waist, her hands ritually fettered",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with little chains that stirred and clashed musically as she moved,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,stiff-legged in a frozen dream. Hair like black grass banded her brow,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and naked shoulders, and her eyes were crimson.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"And the eyes lived in the dead dreaming face. They lived, and they were",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,mad with terror although the lips curved in a gently tranced smile.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Miellyn.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Evarin was speaking in that dialect I barely understood. His arms were,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"flung high and his cloak went spilling away from them, rippling like",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,something alive. The jammed humans and nonhumans swayed and chanted and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"he swayed above them like an iridescent bug, weaving arms rippling back",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and forth, back and forth. I strained to catch his words.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Our world ... an old world.""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Kamayeeeeena,"" whimpered the shrill chorus.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""... humans, humans, all humans would make slaves of us all, all save",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the Children of the Ape....""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I lost the thread for a moment. True. The Terran Empire has one small,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blind spot in otherwise sane policy, ignoring that nonhuman and human",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,have lived placidly here for millennia: they placidly assumed that,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"humans were everywhere the dominant race, as on Earth itself.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The Toymaker's weaving arms went on spinning, spinning. I rubbed my eyes",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to clear them of _shallavan_ and incense. I hoped that what I saw was an,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"illusion of the drug--something, something huge and dark, was hovering",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"over the girl. She stood placidly, hands clasped on her chains, but her",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,eyes writhed in the frozen calm of her face.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Then something--I can only call it a sixth sense--bore it on me that,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,there was _someone_ outside the door. I was perhaps the only creature,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"there, except for Evarin, not drugged with _shallavan_, and perhaps",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,that's all it was. But during the days in the Secret Service I'd had to,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,develop some extra senses. Five just weren't enough for survival.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I _knew_ somebody was fixing to break down that door, and I had a good",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"idea why. I'd been followed, by the legate's orders, and, tracking me",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"here, they'd gone away and brought back reinforcements.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Someone struck a blow on the door and a stentorian voice bawled, ""Open",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"up there, in the name of the Empire!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The chanting broke in ragged quavers. Evarin stopped. Somewhere a woman,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,screamed. The lights abruptly went out and a stampede started in the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"room. Women struck me with chains, men kicked, there were shrieks and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"howls. I thrust my way forward, butting with elbows and knees and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,shoulders.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,A dusky emptiness yawned and I got a glimpse of sunlight and open sky,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and knew that Evarin had stepped through into _somewhere_ and was gone.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The banging on the door sounded like a whole regiment of Spaceforce out,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,there. I dived toward the shimmer of little stars which marked Miellyn's,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"tiara in the darkness, braving the black horror hovering over her, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"touched rigid girl-flesh, cold as death.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I grabbed her and ducked sideways. This time it wasn't intuition--nine,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"times out of ten, anyway, intuition is just a mental shortcut which adds",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,up all the things which your subconscious has noticed while you were,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,busy thinking about something else. Every native building on Wolf had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,concealed entrances and exits and I know where to look for them. This,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,one was exactly where I expected. I pushed at it and found myself in a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"long, dim corridor.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The head of a woman peered from an opening door. She saw Miellyn's limp,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,body hanging on my arm and her mouth widened in a silent scream. Then,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the head popped back out of sight and a door slammed. I heard the bolt,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"slide. I ran for the end of the hall, the girl in my arms, thinking that",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"this was where I came in, as far as Miellyn was concerned, and wondering",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,why I bothered.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The door opened on a dark, peaceful street. One lonely moon was setting",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"beyond the rooftops. I set Miellyn on her feet, but she moaned and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,crumpled against me. I put my shirtcloak around her bare shoulders.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Judging by the noises and yells, we'd gotten out just in time. No one",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"came out the exit behind us. Either the Spaceforce had plugged it or,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"more likely, everyone else in the cellar had been too muddled by drugs",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,to know what was going on.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"But it was only a few minutes, I knew, before Spaceforce would check the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"whole building for concealed escape holes. Suddenly, and irrelevantly, I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"found myself thinking of a day not too long ago, when I'd stood up in",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"front of a unit-in-training of Spaceforce, introduced to them as an",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Intelligence expert on native towns, and solemnly warned them about",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"concealed exits and entrances. I wondered, for half a minute, if it",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,might not be simpler just to wait here and let them pick me up.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Then I hoisted Miellyn across my shoulders. She was heavier than she,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"looked, and after a minute, half conscious, she began to struggle and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"moan. There was a _chak_-run cookshop down the street, a place I'd once",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"known well, with an evil reputation and worse food, but it was quiet and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"stayed open all night. I turned in at the door, bending at the low",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,lintel.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The place was smoke-filled and foul-smelling. I dumped Miellyn on a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"couch and sent the frowsy waiter for two bowls of noodles and coffee,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"handed him a few extra coins, and told him to leave us alone. He",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,probably drew the worst possible inference--I saw his muzzle twitch at,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the smell of _shallavan_--but it was that kind of place anyhow. He drew,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,down the shutters and went.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I stared at the unconscious girl, then shrugged and started on the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"noodles. My own head was still swimmy with the fumes, incense and drug,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and I wanted it clear. I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do, but",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I had Evarin's right-hand girl, and I was going to use her.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"The noodles were greasy and had a curious taste, but they were hot, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I ate all of one bowl before Miellyn stirred and whimpered and put up,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"one hand, with a little clinking of chains, to her hair. The gesture was",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"indefinably reminiscent of Dallisa, and for the first time I saw the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,likeness between them. It made me wary and yet curiously softened.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Finding she could not move freely, she rolled over, sat up and stared",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,around in growing bewilderment and dismay.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""There was a sort of riot,"" I said. ""I got you out. Evarin ditched you.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"And you can quit thinking what you're thinking, I put my shirtcloak on",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,And then some of that primitive male hostility which lives in every man,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"angry, ""Damn it, you're _going_. Have you forgotten that if it weren't",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Outside in the streets it was full day, and the color and life of Charin",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had subsided into listlessness again, a dim morning dullness and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"silence. Only a few men lounged wearily in the streets, as if the sun",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"had sapped their energy. And always the pale fleecy-haired children,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Like this,"" she whispered, pressing herself against me. A staggering",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,whirl of dizzy darkness swung round my head. The street vanished. After,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"meanwhile, an artless and rather tempting view of some delicious",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Not for years had I known that particular sensation--thousands of eyes,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,She touched the crystal to the surface of the screen. Little flickers of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"snow wavered and danced. Then, abruptly, we were looking down from a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,height at the lean back of a man in a leather jacket. Slowly he turned.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,This time there was no pretense of normality as we dashed through the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,And then I was going to bang their heads together. I'd reached a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,occurred within less than a second. We landed in the street-shrine. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,could see the pylon and the bridge and the rising sun of Charin. Then,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"there was the giddy internal wrenching, a blast of icy air whistled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"round us, and we were gazing out at the Polar mountains, ringed in their",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,She clung so violently that it felt as if her small body was trying to,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,push through me and come out the other side. I hung on tight. Miellyn,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,knew what she was doing in the transmitter; I was just along for the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,ride and I didn't relish the thought of being dropped off somewhere in,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"We jumped again, the sickness of disorientation forcing a moan from the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"girl, and darkness shivered round us. I looked on an unfamiliar street",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of black night and dust-bleared stars. She whimpered, ""Evarin knows what",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"some tiny movement, and we would be falling, blind and dizzy, through",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blackness. Halfway through the giddiness, a new direction would wrench",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,giddiness of hyperspace.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Then suddenly I caught a second glimpse of the bridge and the pylon; a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"started to reel down, but my reflexes are fast and I made one swift,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"scrabbling step forward. We lurched, sprawled, locked together, on the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,I lifted Miellyn to her feet. Her eyes were dazed with pain. The ground,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,swayed and rocked under our feet as we fled along the bridge. At the far,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"end, I looked up at the pylon. Judging from its angle, we couldn't be",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,more than a hundred feet from the window through which I'd seen that,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,explaining things to some uninvolved stranger. Then I heard a child's,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"looking up intently not at the woman, but at the pattern of embroideries",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"across her dress. It was very quiet, until Rakhal added, in a gentle and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"girl and said, ""It's over, Rindy, whatever he's done to you. Your mother",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Rindy began to struggle noiselessly, kicking and whimpering, but Miellyn",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"took two quick steps, and flung an inner door open. Rakhal took a stride",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"toward her. She whirled on him, fighting to control the furious little",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"hanging on a hook, before Miellyn kicked the door shut and I heard a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,latch being fastened. Behind the closed door Rindy broke into angry,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"after me, after I rigged that final deal to give you the chance, we",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I stood my ground. ""You'll have to kill me first. And I won't fight you,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Dry-towners in a _shegri_ bet. I knew Rakhal, and I knew he would not",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"knife an unarmed man. ""We fought once with the _kifirgh_ and it didn't",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"flashing, instantaneous memory of Dallisa's threat to drive the knife",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"through my palms. But even while I commanded myself to stand steady,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sheer reflex threw me forward, grabbing at his wrist and the knife.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Between my grappling hand he twisted and I felt the skean drive home,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rip through my jacket with a tearing sound; felt the thin fine line of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"touch, not pain yet, as it sliced flesh. Then pain burned through my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"ribs and I felt hot blood, and I wanted to kill Rakhal, wanted to get my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,hands around his throat and kill him with them. And at the same time I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was raging because I didn't want to fight the crazy fool, I wasn't even",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,mad at him.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Miellyn flung the door open, shrieking, and suddenly the Toy, released,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"was darting a small whirring droning horror, straight at Rakhal's eyes.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,I yelled. But there was no time even to warn him. I bent and butted him,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in the stomach. He grunted, doubled up in agony and fell out of the path",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"of the diving Toy. It whirred in frustration, hovered.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"He writhed in agony, drawing up his knees, clawing at his shirt, while I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,turned on Miellyn in immense fury--and stopped. Hers had been a move of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"desperation, an instinctive act to restore the balance between a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"weaponless man and one who had a knife. Rakhal gasped, in a hoarse voice",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with all the breath gone from it:,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Didn't want to use. Rather fight clean--"" Then he opened his closed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,fist and suddenly there were _two_ of the little whirring droning,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"horrors in the room and this one was diving at me, and as I threw myself",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,headlong to the floor the last puzzle-piece fell into place: Evarin had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,made the same bargain with Rakhal as with me!,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I rolled over, dodging. Behind me in the room there was a child's shrill",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"scream: ""Daddy! Daddy!"" And abruptly the birds collapsed in midair and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,went limp. They fell to the floor like dropping stones and lay there,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"quivering. Rindy dashed across the room, her small skirts flying, and",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,grabbed up one of the terrible vicious things in either hand.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"""Rindy!"" I bellowed. ""No!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"She stood shaking, tears pouring down her round cheeks, a Toy squeezed",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,tight in either hand. Dark veins stood out almost black on her fair,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Rakhal staggered to his feet like a drunken man and snatched one of the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Toys, grinding it under his heel. He made a grab at the second, reeled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and drew an anguished breath. He crumpled up, clutching at his belly",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,where I'd butted him. The bird screamed like a living thing.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Breaking my paralysis of horror I leaped up, ran across the room,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,heedless of the searing pain along my side. I snatched the bird from,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Rindy and it screamed and shrilled and died as my foot crunched the tiny,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,feathers. I stamped the still-moving thing into an amorphous mess and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,kept on stamping and smashing until it was only a heap of powder.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""That was a foul blow, Race, but I--I know why you did it."" He stopped",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and breathed for a minute. Then he muttered, ""You ... saved my life, you",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Still breathing hard, I nodded. Done knowingly, it meant an end of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"blood-feud. However we had wronged each other, whatever the pledges. I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"spoke the words that confirmed it and ended it, finally and forever:",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,Rakhal whirled and with a quick jerk he pulled the skean loose. It had,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"simply been caught in my shirtcloak, in a fold of the rough cloth. He",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"pulled it away, glanced at the red tip, then relaxed. ""Not more than an",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"out her strangled words. ""The other Toys hurt you when I was mad at",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,He called Rindy and spoke softly to her. She looked from her father to,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,to me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Before we ventured into the street, Rakhal scowled at the sprawled",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"embroideries of Miellyn's robe. He said, ""In those things you show up",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"When we reached the street-shrine, Miellyn admonished: ""Stand close",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Rakhal picked up Rindy and hoisted her to his shoulder. Miellyn dropped,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"the cloak she had draped over the pattern of the Nebran embroideries,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,and we crowded close together. The street swayed and vanished and I felt,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,the now-familiar dip and swirl of blackness before the world,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"straightened out again. Rindy was whimpering, dabbing smeary fists at",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,Rakhal flung open the door of the elves' workshop with a shout. The,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,ringing of the anvils shattered into a thousand dissonances as I kicked,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,over a workbench and half-finished Toys crashed in confusion to the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,floor.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,The dwarfs scattered like rabbits before our assault of destruction. I,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"smashed tools, filigree, jewels, stamping everything with my heavy",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"boots. I shattered glass, caught up a hammer and smashed crystals. There",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,was a wild exhilaration to it.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"A tiny doll, proportioned like a woman, dashed toward me, shrilling in a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,and she screamed like a living woman as she came apart. Her blue eyes,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,rolled from her head and lay on the floor watching me. I crushed the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,blue jewels under my heel.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Rakhal swung a tiny hound by the tail. Its head shattered into debris of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,almost-invisible gears and wheels. I caught up a chair and wrecked a,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"glass cabinet of parts with it, swinging furiously. A berserk madness of",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,smashing and breaking had laid hold on me.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I was drunk with crushing and shattering and ruining, when I heard",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,Miellyn scream a warning and turned to see Evarin standing in the,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,doorway. His green cat-eyes blazed with rage. Then he raised both hands,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in a sudden, sardonic gesture, and with a loping, inhuman glide, raced",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,for the transmitter.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Rindy,"" Rakhal panted, ""can you block the transmitter?""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"I looked up, transfixed by horror. I saw a wide rift open, saw the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"skylight shatter and break, and daylight pouring through the cracking",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"walls, Rakhal snatched Rindy up, protecting her from the falling debris",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,with his head and shoulders. I grabbed Miellyn round the waist and we,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,ran for the rift in the buckling wall.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"We shoved through just before the roof caved in and the walls collapsed,",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"and we found ourselves standing on a bare grassy hillside, looking down",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"in shock and horror as below us, section after section of what had been",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,apparently bare hill and rock caved in and collapsed into dusty rubble.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"I didn't understand, but I ran. I ran, my sides aching, blood streaming",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,from the forgotten flesh-wound in my side. Miellyn raced beside me and,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Rakhal stumbled along, carrying Rindy.",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Then the shock of a great explosion rocked the ground, hurling me down",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"full length, Miellyn falling on top of me. Rakhal went down on his",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"knees. Rindy was crying loudly. When I could see straight again, I",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,looked down at the hillside.,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,There was nothing left of Evarin's hideaway or the Mastershrine of,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"Nebran except a great, gaping hole, still oozing smoke and thick black",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"dust. Miellyn said aloud, dazed, ""So _that's_ what he was going to do!""",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Before the others, I could not say what I was thinking, but I put my",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,then suddenly saw something in the symbols across her breasts. Before,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"""Cargill!"" she protested angrily, crimsoning, covering her bare breasts",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"Either keep it locked away, or hide it right out in plain sight. Whoever",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,either in Rakhal or myself. It's not difficult to visualize one's sister,The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"with children, but there was something, some strange incongruity in the",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
19726,"sight of Rakhal carrying the little girl, carefully tucking her up in a",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

19726,"was Rakhal's last adventure. It was going to take him, as he said, years",The Door Through Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""A lot of people would agree with you, Son,"" Captain Rupert Steele had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"said softly. ""The trouble is, if the Lhari spaceport wasn't on Earth, we",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Bart remembered it, five years later, as he got off the strip of moving",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,baggage off the center strip of the moving roadway. Bart Steele and,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Tommy Kendron had graduated together, the day before, from the Space",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""I can manage,"" Tommy chuckled, hefting the plastic cases. ""They don't",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,The two lads stood in front of the spaceport gate for a minute. Over the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"gate, which was high and pointed and made of some clear colorless",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"They walked through the pointed glass gate, and stood for a moment, by",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,This had once been a great desert. Now it was all floored in with some,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"strange substance that was neither glass, metal nor concrete; it looked",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,like gleaming crystal--though it felt soft underfoot--and in the glare,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"of the noonday sun, it gave back the glare in a million rainbow flashes.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Tommy put his hands up to his eyes to shield them. ""The Lhari must have",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"funny eyes, if they can stand all this glare!""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Inside the glass gate, a man in a guard's uniform gave them each a pair",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"of dark glasses. ""Put them on now, boys. And don't look directly at the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Tommy hooked the earpieces of the dark glasses over his ears, and sighed",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"with relief. Bart frowned, but finally put them on. Bart's mother had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"been a Mentorian--from the planet Mentor, of the star Deneb, a hundred",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,times brighter than the sun. Bart had her eyes. But Mentorians weren't,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"popular on Earth, and Bart had learned to be quiet about his mother.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Through the dark lenses, the glare was only a pale gleam. Far out in the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"very center of the spaceport, a high, clear-glass skyscraper rose,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"catching the sunlight in a million colors. Around the building, small",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"copters and robotcabs veered, discharging passengers; and the moving",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,sidewalks were crowded with people coming and going. Here and there in,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the crowd, standing out because of their height and the silvery metallic",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"cloaks they wore, were the strange tall figures of the Lhari.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Well, how about going down?"" Tommy glanced impatiently at his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""All right. We can get a sidewalk over here."" Reluctantly, Bart tore his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"eyes from the fascinating spectacle, and followed Tommy, stepping onto",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"one of the sidewalks. It bore them down a long, sloping ramp toward the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"floor of the spaceport, then sped toward the glass skyscraper; came to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"rest at the wide pointed doors, depositing them in the midst of the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,crowd. The jagged lightning flash was there over the doors of the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"building, and the words:",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart remembered, as if it were yesterday, how he and his father had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"first passed through this doorway. And his father, looking up, had said",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"under his breath ""Not for always, Son. Someday men will have a doorway",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"to the stars, and the Lhari won't be standing in the door.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Inside the building, it was searingly bright. The high open rotunda was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"filled with immense mirrors, and glass ramps running up and down, moving",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"staircases, confusing signs and flashing lights on tall oddly shaped",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"pillars. The place was crowded with men from all over the planet, but",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,the dark glasses they all wore gave them a strange sort of family,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Tommy said, ""I'd better check my reservations.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart nodded. ""Meet you on the upper level later,"" he said, and got on a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"moving staircase that soared slowly upward, past level after level,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,toward the information desk located on the topmost mezzanine.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The staircase moved slowly, and Bart had plenty of time to see",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"everything. On the step immediately in front of him, two Lhari were",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"standing; with their backs turned, they might almost have been men.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Unusually tall, unusually thin, but men. Then Bart amended that",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"mentally. The Lhari had two arms, two legs and a head apiece--they were",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"that much like men. Their faces had two eyes, two ears, and a nose and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"mouth, all in the right places. But the similarity ended there.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"They had skin of a curious pale silvery gray, and pale, pure-white hair",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,rising in what looked like a feathery crest. The eyes were long and,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"slanting, the forehead high and narrow, the nose delicately thin and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"chiseled with long vertically slit nostrils, the ears long, pointed and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"lobeless. The mouth looked almost human, though the chin was abnormally",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,pointed. The hands would almost have passed inspection as human,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"hands--except for the long, triangular nails curved over the fingertips",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,like the claws of a cat. They wore skin-tight clothes of some metallic,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"silky stuff, and long flowing gleaming silvery capes. They looked",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"unearthly, elfin and strange, and in their own way they were beautiful.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The two Lhari in front of Bart had been talking softly, in their fast",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,twittering speech; but as the hum of the crowds on the upper levels grew,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"louder, they raised their voices, and Bart could hear what they were",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,saying. He was a little surprised to find that he could still understand,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,the Lhari language. He hadn't heard a word of it in years--not since his,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Mentorian mother died. The Lhari would never guess that he could,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,understand their speech. Not one human in a million could speak or,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,man managed to get away. What worries me is the possibility that he may,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Mentorians in the crowd who might understand us."" He turned and looked",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"straight at Bart, and Bart felt as if the slanted strange eyes were",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"looking right through to his bones. The Lhari said, in Universal, ""Who",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"are you, boy? What iss your businesssses here?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""Up there,"" said the old Lhari, pointing with a clawed hand, and lost",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"interest in Bart. He said to his companion, in their own language,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Always, I regret these episodes. I have no malice against humans. I",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,The soaring staircase swooped up to the top level; the two Lhari stepped,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"off and mingled swiftly with the crowd, being lost to sight. Bart",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,whistled in dismay as he got off and turned toward the information desk.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,A Vegan! Some poor guy from his own planet was in trouble with the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Lhari. He felt a cold, crawling chill down his insides. The Lhari had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"spoken regretfully, but the way they'd speak of a fly they couldn't",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"manage to swat fast enough. Sooner or later you had to get down to it,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,they just weren't human!,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Once you walked beneath the lightning-flash sign, the authority of the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"drink?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,There was a refreshment stand on this level; they debated briefly,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,between orange juice and a drink with a Lhari name that meant simply,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"_cold sweet_, and finally decided to try it. The name proved",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"descriptive; it was very cold, very sweet and indescribably delicious.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"They had the same body chemistry--in fact, you couldn't tell Lhari blood",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"from human, even under a microscope. And in the terrible Orion Spaceport",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"wreck sixty years ago, doctors had found that blood plasma from humans",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"could be used for wounded Lhari, and vice versa, though it wasn't safe",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"to transfuse whole blood. But then, even among humans there were five",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Bart sipped the cold Lhari drink, seeing himself in the mirror behind",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the refreshment stand; a tall teen-ager, looking older than his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,seventeen years. He was lithe and well muscled from five years of sports,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"It was a sore point with everyone. Thousands of years ago, men had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,crawling in ships that could travel no faster than the speed of light.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,They had even believed that was an absolute limit--that nothing in the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,to the nearest star.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"But they'd done it. From the nearer stars, they had sent out colonizing",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,ships all through the galaxy. Some vanished and were never heard from,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,extremely profitable.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Because men were still held, mostly, to the planets of their own",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"overnight the whole picture changed. By warp-drive, hundreds of times",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"faster than light at peak, the years-long trip between Vega and Earth,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"for instance, was reduced to about three months, at a price anyone could",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"hand. ""Well, Bart, I guess this is where we say good-bye.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"They shook hands, their eyes meeting for a moment in honest grief. In",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"some indefinable way, this parting marked the end of their boyhood.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Good luck, Tom. I'm going to miss you.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"They wrung each other's hands again, hard. Then Tommy picked up his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,luggage and started down a sloping ramp toward an enclosure marked TO,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,PASSENGER ENTRANCE.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Warning bells rang again. The glare intensified until the glow in the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"sky was unendurable, but Bart looked anyhow, making out the strange",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,shape of the Lhari ship from the stars.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"It was huge and strange, glowing with colors Bart had never seen before.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"It settled down slowly, softly: enormous, silent, vibrating, glowing;",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"then swiftly faded to white-hot, gleaming blue, dulling down through the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,visible spectrum to red. At last it was just gleaming glassy Lhari-metal,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"color again. High up in the ship's side a yawning gap slid open,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"extruding stairsteps, and men and Lhari began to descend.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Bart ran down a ramp and surged out on the field with the crowd. His,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"eyes, alert for his father's tall figure, noted with surprise that the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"ship's stairs were guarded by four cloaked Lhari, each with a Mentorian",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"interpreter. They were stopping each person who got off the starship,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,asking for identity papers. Bart realized he was seeing another segment,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"of the same drama he had overheard discussed, and wished he knew what it",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,was all about.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The crowd was thinning now. Robotcabs were swerving in, hovering above",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the ground to pick up passengers, then veering away. The gap in the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"starship's side was closing, and still Bart had not seen the tall, slim,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,flame-haired figure of his father. The port on the other side of the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"ship, he knew, was for loading passengers. Bart moved carefully through",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the thinning crowd, almost to the foot of the stairs. One of the Lhari",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"checking papers stopped and fixed him with an inscrutable gray stare,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,but finally turned away again.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Bart began really to worry. Captain Steele would never miss his ship!,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,But he saw only one disembarking passenger who had not yet been,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"surrounded by a group of welcoming relatives, or summoned a robotcab and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"gone. The man was wearing Vegan clothes, but he wasn't Bart's father. He",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"was a fat little man, with ruddy cheeks and a fringe of curling gray",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,hair all around his bald dome. _Maybe he'd know if there was another,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Vegan on the ship._,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Then Bart realized that the little fat man was staring straight at him.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"He returned the man's smile, rather hesitantly; then blinked, for the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,fat man was coming straight toward him.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Hello, Son,"" the fat man said loudly. Then, as two of the Lhari started",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"toward him, the strange man did an incredible thing. He reached out his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,two hands and grabbed Bart.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Well, boy, you've sure grown,"" he said, in a loud, cheerful voice, ""but",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"you're not too grown-up to give your old Dad a good hug, are you?"" He",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,pulled Bart roughly into his arms. Bart started to pull away and stammer,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"that the fat man had made a mistake, but the pudgy hand gripped his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,wrist with unexpected strength.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Bart, listen to me,"" the stranger whispered, in a harsh fast voice. ""Go",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,along with this or we're both dead. See those two Lhari watching us?,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Call me Dad, good and loud, if you want to live. Because, believe me,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"For a moment, pulled off balance in the fat stranger's hug, Bart",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"remained perfectly still, while the man repeated in that loud, jovial",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"voice, ""How you've grown!"" He let him go, stepping away a pace or two,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"and whispered urgently, ""Say something. And take that stupid look off",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"your face.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"As he stepped back, Bart saw his eyes. In the chubby, good-natured red",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"face, the stranger's eyes were half-mad with fear.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"In a split second, Bart remembered the two Lhari and their talk of a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"fugitive. In that moment, Bart Steele grew up.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,He stepped toward the man and took him quickly by the shoulders.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Dad, you sure surprised me,"" he said, trying to keep his voice from",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"shaking. ""Been such a long time, I'd--half forgotten what you looked",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"like. Have a good trip?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""About like always."" The fat man was breathing hard, but his voice",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"sounded firm and cheerful. ""Can't compare with a trip on the old",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"_Asterion_ though."" The _Asterion_ was the flagship of Vega Interplanet,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Rupert Steele's own ship. ""How's everything?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Beads of sweat were standing out on the man's ruddy forehead, and his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"grip on Bart's wrist was so hard it hurt. Bart, grasping at random for",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"something to say, gabbled, ""Too bad you couldn't get to my graduation. I",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"made th-third in a class of four hundred--""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,The Lhari had surrounded them and were closing in.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The fat man took a deep breath or two, said, ""Just a minute, Son,"" and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"turned around. ""You want something?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The tallest of the Lhari--the old one, whom Bart had seen on the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"escalator--looked long and hard at him. When they spoke Universal, their",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"voices were sibilant, but not nearly so inhuman.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Could we trrrouble you to sssshow us your paperrrssss?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Certainly."" Nonchalantly, the fat man dug them out and handed them",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"The Lhari gestured to a Mentorian interpreter: ""What colorrr isss thisss",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"The Mentorian said in the Lhari language, ""His hair is _gray_."" He used",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the Universal word; there were, of course, no words for colors in the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Lhari speech.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""The man we sssseek has hair of _red_,"" said the Lhari. ""And he isss",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""This boy is twenty years younger than the man whose description came to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"the other Lhari and said in their own shrill speech, ""I suspected this",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"and spoken with him. We watched him, knowing sooner or later the father",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Bart gulped. For the first time he noted the energon-ray shockers at the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,belts of the four Lhari. He'd heard about those. They could stun--or,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"they could kill, and quite horribly. He said, ""This is my father. You",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""Let's get going, Son,"" said the little bald man. His hand shook on",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart's, and Bart thought, _If we're lucky, we can get out of the port",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"before he faints dead away._ He said ""I'll get a copter,"" and then,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"feeling sorry for the stranger, gave him his arm to lean on. He didn't",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,know whether he was worried or scared. _Where was his father?_ Why did,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,this man have his dad's papers? Was his father hiding inside the Lhari,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"ship? He wanted to run, to burst away from the imposter, but the guy was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,shaking so hard Bart couldn't just leave him standing there. If the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"A copter swooped down, the pilot signaling. The little man said",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Bart waved the copter away, getting a dirty look from the pilot, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,punched a button at the stand for one of the unmanned robotcabs. It,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"swung down, hovered motionless. Bart boosted the fat man in. Inside, the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,rapidly that Bart fell against the fat man's shoulder.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Are you crazy? What are you going to do?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Briscoe looked straight into Bart's eyes. In his hoarse, sick voice, he",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"said, ""Bart, don't worry about me. It's all over for me, whatever",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"happens. Just remember this. What your father is doing is _worth_ doing,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"and if you start stalling, arguing, demanding explanations, you can foul",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"up a hundred people--and kill about half of them.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,He closed Bart's fingers roughly over the papers. The robotcab hovered,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"over the spaceport. ""Now listen to me, very carefully. When I stop the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"cab, down below, jump out. Don't stop to say good-bye, or ask questions,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"or anything else. Just get out, walk straight through the passenger door",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"and straight up the ramp of the ship. Show them that ticket, and get on.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Whatever happens, don't let anything stop you. Bart!"" Briscoe shook his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"shoulder. ""Promise! Whatever happens, you'll _get on that ship_!""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart swallowed, feeling as if he'd been shoved into a silly",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"cops-and-robbers game. But Briscoe's urgency had convinced him. ""Where",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"am I going?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""All I have is a name--Raynor Three,"" Briscoe said, ""and the message",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"about the Eighth Color. That's all I know."" His mouth twisted again in",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,that painful gasp.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The cab swooped down. Bart found his voice. ""But what then? Is Dad",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""I don't know any more than I've told you,"" Briscoe said. Abruptly the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"robotcab came to a halt, swaying a little. Briscoe jerked the door open,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"gave Bart a push, and Bart found himself stumbling out on the ramp",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"beside the spaceport building. He caught his balance, looked around, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,realized that the robotcab was already climbing the sky again.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Immediately before him, neon letters spelled TO PASSENGER ENTRANCE",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"disinterested claw. Bart held up what Briscoe had shoved into his hand,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"only now seeing that it was a thin wallet, a set of identity papers and a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Bart went through the narrow passageway, came out at the other end, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,found himself at the very base of a curving stair that led up and up,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,toward a door in the side of the huge Lhari ship. Bart hesitated. In,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"another minute he'd be on his way to a strange sun and a strange world,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,on what might well be the wild-goose chase of all time.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Passengers were crowding the steps behind him. Someone shouted suddenly,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""Look at that!"" and someone else yelled, ""Is that guy crazy?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart looked up. A robotcab was swooping over the spaceport in wild,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"crazy circles, dipping down, suddenly making a dart like an enraged wasp",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,at a little nest of Lhari. They ducked and scattered; the robotcab,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"swerved away, hovered, swooped back. This time it struck one of the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Lhari grazingly with landing gear and knocked him sprawling. Bart stood,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"with his mouth open, as if paralyzed.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,_Briscoe! What was he doing?_,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The fallen Lhari lay without moving. The robotcab moved in again, as if",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"for the kill, buzzing viciously overhead.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Then a beam of light arced from one of the drawn energon-ray tubes. The,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"robotcab glowed briefly red, then seemed to sag, sink together; then",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"puddled, a slag heap of molten metal, on the glassy floor of the port. A",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"little moan of horror came from the crowd, and Bart felt a sudden,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"wrenching sickness. It had been like a game, a silly game of cops and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"robbers, and suddenly it was as serious as melted death lying there on",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,the spaceport. _Briscoe!_,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Someone shoved him and said, ""Come on, quit gawking, kid. They won't",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart, his legs numb, walked up the ramp. Briscoe had died to give him",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"At the top of the ramp, a Lhari glanced briefly at his papers, motioned",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"him through. Bart passed through the airlock, and into a brightly lit",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"corridor half full of passengers. The line was moving slowly, and for",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,the first time Bart had a chance to think.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"He had never seen violent death before. In this civilized world, you",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"didn't. He knew if he thought about Briscoe, he'd start bawling like a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"baby, so he swallowed hard a couple of times, set his chin, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,concentrated on the trip to Procyon Alpha. That meant this ship was,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"outbound on the Aldebaran run--Proxima Centauri, Sirius, Pollux,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Procyon, Capella and Aldebaran.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,The line of passengers was disappearing through a doorway. A woman ahead,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"of Bart turned and said nervously, ""We won't be put into cold-sleep",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"right away, will we?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"He reassured her, remembering his inbound trip five years ago. ""No, no.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,The ship won't go into warp-drive until we're well past Pluto. It will,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"be several days, at least.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Beyond the doorway the lights dwindled, and a Mentorian interpreter took",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"his dark glasses, saying, ""Kindly remove your belt, shoes and other",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,accessories of leather or metal before stepping into the decontamination,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Papers, please.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"With a small twinge of fright, Bart surrendered them. Would the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Mentorian ask why he was carrying two wallets? Inside the other one, he",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"still had his Academy ID card which identified him as Bart Steele, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"if the Mentorian looked through them to check, and found out he was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,carrying two sets of identity papers....,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"But the Mentorian merely dumped all his pocket paraphernalia, without",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"looking at it, into a sack. ""Just step through here.""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Holding up his trousers with both hands, Bart stepped inside the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,indicated cubicle. It was filled with faint bluish light. Bart felt a,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"strong tingling and a faint electrical smell, and along his forearms",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,there was a slight prickling where the small hairs were all standing on,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,end. He knew that the invisible R-rays were killing all the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"microorganisms in his body, so that no disease germ or stray fungus",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,would be carried from planet to planet.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The green stuff tasted a little brackish, but Bart got it down all",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"right. He didn't much like the idea of drinking a solution of ""germs,""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,but he knew that was silly. There was a big difference between disease,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,germs and helpful bacteria.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Another Mentorian official, this one a young woman, gave him a key with",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"a numbered tag, and a small booklet with WELCOME ABOARD printed",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,on the cover.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The tag was numbered 246-B, which made Bart raise his eyebrows. B class",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,was normally too expensive for Bart's father's modest purse. It wasn't,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"quite the luxury class A, reserved for planetary governors and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"ambassadors, but it was plenty luxurious. Briscoe had certainly sent him",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,traveling in style!,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"B Deck was a long corridor with oval doors; Bart found one numbered 246,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"and, not surprisingly, the key opened it. It was a pleasant little",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"cabin, measuring at least six feet by eight, and he would evidently have",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"it to himself. There was a comfortably big bunk, a light that could be",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,turned on and off instead of the permanent glow-walls of the cheaper,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"class, a private shower and toilet, and a placard on the walls informing",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,him that passengers in B class had the freedom of the Observation Dome,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,and the Recreation Lounge. There was even a row of buttons dispensing,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"synthetic foods, in case a passenger preferred privacy or didn't want to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,wait for meals in the dining hall.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"A buzzer sounded and a Mentorian voice announced, ""Five minutes to Room",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Check. Passengers will please remove all metal in their clothing, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,deposit in the lead drawers. Passengers will please recline in their,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Bart took off his belt, stuck it and his cuff links in the drawer and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"lay down. Then, in a sudden panic, he got up again. His papers as Bart",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Steele were still in the sack. He got them out, and with a feeling as if",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"he were crossing a bridge and burning it after him, tore up every scrap",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"of paper that identified him as Bart Steele of Vega Four, graduate of",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the Space Academy of Earth. Now, for better or worse, he was--who _was_",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,he? He hadn't even looked at the new papers Briscoe had given him!,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,He glanced through them quickly. They were made out to David Warren,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Briscoe, of Aldebaran Four. According to them, David Briscoe was twenty",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"years old, hair black, eyes hazel, height six foot one inch. Bart",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"wondered, painfully, if Briscoe had a son and if David Briscoe knew",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"where his father was. There was also a license, validated with four runs",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,on the Aldebaran Intrasatellite Cargo Company--planetary ships--with the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,rank of Apprentice Astrogator; and a considerable sum of money.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Bart put the papers in his pants pocket and the torn-up scraps of his,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,old ones into the trashbin before he realized that they looked exactly,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,like what they were--torn-up legal identity papers and a broken plastic,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,card. _Nobody_ destroyed identity papers for any good reason. What could,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,he do?,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Then he remembered something from the Academy. Starships were,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"closed-system cycles, no waste was discarded, but everything was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"collected in big chemical tanks, broken down to separate elements,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,purified and built up again into new materials. He threw the paper into,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the toilet, worked the plastic card back and forth, back and forth until",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"he had wrenched it into inch-wide bits, and threw it after them.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The cabin door opened and a Mentorian said irritably, ""Please lie down",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Hastily Bart flushed the toilet and went to the bunk. Now everything,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,that could identify him as Bart Steele was on its way to the breakdown,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"tanks. Before long, the complex hydrocarbons and cellulose would all be",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"innocent little molecules of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen; they might turn",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,up in new combinations as sugar on the table!,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The Mentorian grumbled, ""You young people think the rules mean everybody",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"but you,"" and strapped him far too tightly into the bunk. Bart felt",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"resentful; just because Mentorians could work on Lhari ships, did they",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,have to act as if they owned everybody?,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"When the man had gone, Bart drew a deep breath. Was he really doing the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,right thing?,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,If he'd refused to get out of the robotcab--,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,If he'd driven Briscoe straight to the police--,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,Then maybe Briscoe would still be alive. And now it was too late.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"A warning siren went off in the ship, rising to hysterical intensity.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart thought, incredulously, _this is really happening_. It felt like a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"himself traveling, with forged papers, to a star he'd never seen.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"He braced himself, knowing the siren was the last warning before",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,takeoff. First there would be the hum of great turbines deep in the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"ship, then the crushing surge of acceleration. He had made a dozen trips",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"inside the solar system, but no matter how often he did it, there was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"the strange excitement, the little pinpoint of fear, like an exotic",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"taste, that was almost pleasant.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"A low hum rose, somewhere in the ship, and Bart grabbed ticking as he",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,felt the slow surge. Then a violent sense of pressure popped his ear,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,and there was a horrible squashed sensation dragging his limbs out of,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"shape. It grew and grew. Bart lay still and sweated, trying to ease his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"uncomfortable position, unable to move so much as a finger. The Lhari",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Abruptly, it eased, and the blood started to flow again in his numbed",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"face--wringing wet, whether with sweat or tears he wasn't sure--and sat",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"It had been darkened, and one whole wall of the room was made of clear",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Back in his cabin, he gloomily dialed some synthetic jellies, thinking",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,with annoyance of the anticipated good food of the dining room. He knew,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"he couldn't risk meeting Tommy again, and drearily resigned himself to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,staying in his cabin. It looked like an awfully boring trip ahead.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"It was. It was a week before the Lhari ship went into warp-drive, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"all that time Bart stayed in his cabin, not daring to go to the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,observation Lounge or dining hall. He got tired of eating synthetics,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"(oh, they were nourishing enough, but they were altogether",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,uninteresting) and tired of listening to the tapes the room steward got,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"him from the ship's library. By the time they had been in space a week,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,he was so bored with his own company that even the Mentorian medic was a,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,welcome sight when he came in to prepare him for cold-sleep.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart had had the best education on Earth, but he didn't know precisely",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,how the Lhari warp-drive worked. He'd been told that only a few of the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Lhari understood it, just as the man who flew a copter didn't need to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,understand Newton's Three Laws of Motion in order to get himself back,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,and forth to work.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,But he knew this much; when the ship generated the frequencies which,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"accelerated it beyond the speed of light, in effect the ship went into a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"sort of fourth dimension, and came out of it a good many light-years",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"away. As far as Bart knew, no human being had ever survived warp-drive",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,except in the suspended animation which they called cold-sleep. While,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,the medic was professionally reassuring him and strapping him in his,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"bunk, Bart wondered what humans would do with the Lhari star-drive if",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"they had it. Well, he supposed they could use automation in their ships.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,Bart wondered if the room steward had mentioned the passenger so bored,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,with the trip that he didn't even visit the Observation Lounge. He felt,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,tempted--he was getting awfully tired of staring at the walls. On the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"other hand, he wanted very much to see the other star-systems. When he",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"passed through them on the trip to Earth, he'd been too young to pay",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,much attention.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Firmly he put the temptation aside. Better not to risk meeting other,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,boredom.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"The needle went into his arm. He felt himself sinking into sleep, and,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"in sudden panic, realized that he was helpless. The ship would touch",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"down on three worlds, and on any of them the Lhari might have his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"description, or his alias! He could be taken off, drugged and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"tell them he was changing his mind, but already he was unable to speak.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"There was a freezing moment of intense, painful cold. Then he was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"floating in what felt like waves of cosmic dust, swirling many-colored",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Bart felt cold. He stirred, moved his head in drowsy protest; then",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,Bart's legs were numb and his hands tingled when he sat up; but his body,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,processes had been slowed so much by the cold-sleep that he didn't even,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,Tommy would probably remember the snub he'd had and stay away from Dave,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"He broke off in mid-word, realizing that Tommy was gazing at him in a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"mixture of triumph and consternation. Too late, Bart realized he had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,At first sight it was a disappointment. It was a Lhari spaceport that,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"sloping glass ramps, tall colorless pylons, a skyscraper terminus",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"some colorful story moving on it, small bright figures in capes, curious",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,beasts racing across an unusual veldt; but Bart paced the floor,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"restlessly. There were two doors in the room. Through one of them, he",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"had been admitted; he could see, through the glass door, the silhouette",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"through the lids there was pain and red afterimages; but after a moment,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"opening them a slit, he found that he could see, and made out other",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,leading down to what he hoped was street level was terribly steep and,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,silvery tights and cloak that Raynor had provided. He could use his,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,hands now as if they belonged to him; he even found the claws handy and,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,with the crowd and hired a skycab from an unobservant human driver to,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"When the skycab let him off before the spaceport, it felt strange to see",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"caught a glimpse of himself in one of the mirror-ramps, a tall thin",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,getting a snack at one of these.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"No, that was just putting it off. The time had to come when he must face",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,his fear and test his disguise among the Lhari themselves. Reviewing his,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"knowledge of the construction of spaceports, he remembered that one side",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"was the terminal, where humans and visitors and passengers were freely",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"admitted; the other side, for Lhari and their Mentorian employees only,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,contained--along with business offices of many sorts--a sort of arcade,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"with amusement centers, shops and restaurants catering to the personnel",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"of the Lhari ships. With nine or ten ships docking every day, Raynor had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"egg-and-fish casserole which Bart found extremely tasty, and he dug into",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"shabbier than on the clean, bright, commercial passenger decks Bart had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,seen. Dark-lensed men were rolling bales of cargo along on wheeled,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,He decided to go down to the port again and look around the shops. He,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"getting bored with this voyage. And yet I don't want it to end, because",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,then I'll have to fight it out all over again with my family. My father,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"owns a hotel, and he wants me in the family business, not five hundred",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"explained, ""and they don't understand that living on one planet would",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"people--that you couldn't be happy in the mud? Or are you a career man?""",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"""I guess so. I never thought about doing anything else,"" Bart said",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"slowly, Ringg's story had touched him; he had never realized quite so",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"fully how much alike the two races were, how human the Lhari problems",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"and dreams could seem. _Why, of course, the Lhari aren't all spacemen.",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"It looked to Bart as if it were at least golf-ball size, and seemed to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"""What's the matter?"" Bart, arm curved to protect his skull, bent over",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"felt sharp pain in his arm, felt the hail hard as thrown stones raining",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"on his head. Ringg was out cold. _If they stayed in this_, Bart thought",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"despairingly, _they'd both be dead!_",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Crouching, trying to duck his head between his shoulders, Bart got his",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"arms under Ringg's armpits and half-carried, half-dragged him under the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,lee of the cliffs. He slipped and slid on the thickening layer of ice,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"underfoot, lost his footing, and came down, hard, one arm twisted",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"between himself and the cliff. He cried out in pain, uncontrollably, and",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,let Ringg slip from his grasp. The Lhari boy lay like the dead.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart bent over him, breathing hard, trying to get his breath back. The",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"hail was still pelting down, showing no signs of lessening. About five",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"feet away, one of the dark gaps in the cliff showed wide and menacing,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"but at least, Bart thought, the hail couldn't come in there. He stooped",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,and got hold of Ringg again. A pain like fire went through the wrist he,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"had smashed against the rock. He set his teeth, wondering if it had",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"broken. The effort made him see stars, but he managed somehow to hoist",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Ringg up again and haul him through the pelting hail toward the yawning,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"gap. It darkened around them, and, blessedly, the battering, bruising",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,hail could not reach them. Only an occasional light splinter of ice blew,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,with the bitter wind into the mouth of the cave.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Bart laid Ringg down on the floor, under the shelter of the rock",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,His forehead was covered with blood.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Bart took one of the paper napkins from the lunch sack and carefully,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"wiped some of it away. His stomach turned at the deep, ugly cut, which",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,immediately started oozing fresh blood. He pressed the edges of the cut,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"together with the napkin, wondering helplessly how much blood Ringg",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"could lose without danger, and if he had concussion. If he tried to go",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"back to the ship and fetch the medic for Ringg, he'd be struck by hail",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"himself. From where he stood, it seemed that the hailstones were getting",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,bigger by the minute.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"_This is nonsense,_ he told himself firmly, _I'll just walk back there",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"At his belt he had the small flashlamp, excessively bright, that was,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"like the energon-beam shocker, a part of regulation equipment. He took",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"it out, shining it on the back wall of the cave; then drew a long breath",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"glowed there, giant crystals, like jewels, crusted with strange",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"shimmering among them, a strangely colored crystalline mineral that he",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"had never seen before. It was blue--_No_, Bart thought, _that's just the",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"Ringg moaned, and Bart, glancing round, saw that he was struggling to",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"sit up. He ran back to him, dropping to his knees at Ringg's side. ""It's",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"up, he flinched, and Bart said, ""You'd better lie still."" He knew that",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,head injuries should be kept very quiet; he was almost afraid to leave,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,Ringg for fear the Lhari boy would have another delirious fit and hurt,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"The hail had stopped, and the piled heaps were already melting, but it",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"had been so pink and flowery in the sunshine. The _Swiftwing_, a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"monstrous dark egg looming in the twilight, seemed like home. Bart felt",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Small as it was, it was blazingly blue-white brilliant, and had a tiny",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"inhabited planets in this system, where the Lhari spaceport was",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"As Bart watched Antares growing in the viewports, he felt a variety of",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"would they, unthinkably, demand that he go on into the Lhari Galaxy?",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"What would he do, if they did?",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,At one moment he entertained fantasies of going on into the Lhari,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"worlds, returning victorious with the secret of their fueling location,",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"or of the star-drive itself. At another, he could not wait to be free of",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"it all. He longed for the society of his own people, yet ached to think",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,that this voyage between the stars must end so soon.,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"ashore, returning with exchanged mail and messages for the _Swiftwing_'s",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,He slipped away unobserved to the Mentorian part of the ship to borrow a,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"With the blue cloak folded around his face, hands tucked in the slits at",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"little, fragrant gusts of wind, he almost savored the sense of being a",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"like purple glass. Bart, moving slowly through the gate, felt that eyes",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"and shut again, closing out the red sunset, letting him into a room that",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,seemed dim after the months of Lhari lights. There were three men in the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"a long, endless moment he saw Montano's chest twitch and knew the man",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"Well, Montano would be safe here in the bunker. Hastily, Bart looked at",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,a closed surface car. It whisked him away to a building he did not see,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,from the outside; he was taken up by private elevator to a suite of,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,rooms which might--for all he could tell--have been a suite in a luxury,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"hotel or a lunatic asylum. The walls were translucent, the furniture",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"oddly colored, and so carefully padded that even a homicidal or suicidal",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"enough to keep him from being bored between meals, or from brooding. Two",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"were deaf and dumb, did not understand his dialect of Lhari, or were",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,One day it ended. A Lhari and a Mentorian came for him and took him down,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,dropped. Cold common sense doused over his brave thoughts. He was,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

20796,"when he floated without a body, and then another time when the path of",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,"every separate nerve in his body seemed to be outlined, a shimmering web",The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,in the gray murk. There was a mirror and a face. There were blotchy,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
20796,worms of light like the star-trails of peaking warp-drive through the,The Colors of Space,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,started farming at the foot of Scuttock Mountain. That's Injun for,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,"Anyhow, when the ice went out there was an almighty good thaw all over,",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,and when the snow run off Scuttock mountain there was a good-sized hunk,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,of farmland in our valley went under water. The crick on my farm flowed,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"over the bank and there was a foot of water in the cowshed, and down in",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,the swimmin' hole in the back pasture wasn't nothing but a big gully,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"fifty foot and more across, rushing through the pasture, deep as a lake",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,and brown as the old cow. You know freshet-floods? Full up with sticks,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,and stones and old dead trees and somebody's old shed floatin' down the,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,I tied the cow and the calf and Kate--she was our white mare; you mind,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,"Anyhow, I tied the whole kit and caboodle of them in the woodshed up",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"behind the house, where they'd be dry, then I started to get the",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,milkpail. Right then I heard the gosh-awfullest screech I ever heard in,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,my life. Sounded like thunder and a freshet and a forest-fire all at,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"once. I dropped the milkpail as I heard Marthy scream inside the house,",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,and I run outside. Marthy was already there in the yard and she points,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"up in the sky and yelled, ""Look up yander!""",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,We stood looking up at the sky over Shattuck mountain where there was a,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"great big--shoot now, I d'no as I can call its name but it was like a",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"trail of fire in the sky, and it was makin' the dangdest racket you ever",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"heard, Rev'rend. Looked kind of like one of them Fourth-of-July",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"skyrockets, but it was big as a house. Marthy was screaming and she",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"grabbed me and hollered, ""Hez! Hez, what in tunket is it?"" And when",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"Marthy cusses like that, Rev'rend, she don't know what she's saying,",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,she's so scared.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"I was plumb scared myself. I heard Liza--that's our young-un, Liza",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"Grace, that got married to the Taylor boy. I heard her crying on the",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,Marthy that the pea soup was burning. Marthy let out another screech and,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,ran for the house. That's a woman for you. So I quietened Liza down some,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,and I went in and told Marthy it weren't no more than one of them,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,shooting stars. Then I went and did the milking.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"But you know, while we were sitting down to supper there came the most",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"awful grinding, screeching, pounding crash I ever heard. Sounded if it",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,were in the back pasture but the house shook as if somethin' had hit it.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,Marthy jumped a mile and I never saw such a look on her face.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"""Hez, what was that?"" she asked.",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"""Shoot, now, nothing but the freshet,"" I told her.",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"But she kept on about it. ""You reckon that shooting star fell in our",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"""Well, now, I don't 'low it did nothing like that,"" I told her. But she",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,was jittery as an old hen and it weren't like her nohow. She said it,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,sounded like trouble and I finally quietened her down by saying I'd,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"saddle Kate up and go have a look. I kind of thought, though I didn't",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"tell Marthy, that somebody's house had floated away in the freshet and",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,run aground in our back pasture.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,So I saddled up Kate and told Marthy to get some hot rum ready in case,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,there was some poor soul run aground back there. And I rode Kate back to,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,the back pasture.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"It was mostly uphill because the top of the pasture is on high ground,",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,and it sloped down to the crick on the other side of the rise.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"Well, I reached the top of the hill and looked down. The crick were a",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"regular river now, rushing along like Niagary. On the other side of it",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"was a stand of timber, then the slope of Shattuck mountain. And I saw",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,right away the long streak where all the timber had been cut out in a,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,big scoop with roots standing up in the air and a big slide of rocks,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,down to the water.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,It was still raining a mite and the ground was sloshy and squanchy,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"under foot. Kate scrunched her hooves and got real balky, not likin' it",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,a bit. When we got to the top of the pasture she started to whine and,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"whicker and stamp, and no matter how loud I whoa-ed she kept on",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,a-stamping and I was plumb scared she'd pitch me off in the mud. Then I,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"started to smell a funny smell, like somethin' burning. Now, don't ask",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"me how anything could burn in all that water, because I don't know.",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,When we came up on the rise I saw the contraption.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"Rev'rend, it was the most tarnal crazy contraption I ever saw in my",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,life. It was bigger nor my cowshed and it was long and thin and as shiny,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,as Marthy's old pewter pitcher her Ma brought from England. It had a,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,pair of red rods sticking out behind and a crazy globe fitted up where,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"the top ought to be. It was stuck in the mud, turned halfway over on the",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"little slide of roots and rocks, and I could see what had happened, all",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,right.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"The thing must have been--now, Rev'rend, you can say what you like but",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,that thing must have _flew_ across Shattuck and landed on the slope in,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"the trees, then turned over and slid down the hill. That must have been",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"the crash we heard. The rods weren't just red, they were _red-hot_. I",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,could hear them sizzle as the rain hit 'em.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"In the middle of the infernal contraption there was a door, and it hung",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,all to-other as if every hinge on it had been wrenched halfway off. As I,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,pushed old Kate alongside it I heared somebody hollering alongside the,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,contraption. I didn't nohow get the words but it must have been for,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"help, because I looked down and there was a man a-flopping along in the",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,water.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"He was a big fellow and he wasn't swimming, just thrashin' and",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,hollering. So I pulled off my coat and boots and hove in after him. The,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,stream was running fast but he was near the edge and I managed to catch,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"on to an old tree-root and hang on, keeping his head out of the water",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,till I got my feet aground. Then I hauled him onto the bank. Up above me,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,Kate was still whinnying and raising Ned and I shouted at her as I bent,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,over the man.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"Wal, Rev'rend, he sure did give me a surprise--weren't no proper man I'd",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"ever seed before. He was wearing some kind of red clothes, real shiny",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"and sort of stretchy and not wet from the water, like you'd expect, but",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,dry and it felt like that silk and India-rubber stuff mixed together.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,And it was such a bright red that at first I didn't see the blood on it.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"When I did I knew he were a goner. His chest were all stove in, smashed",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,to pieces. One of the old tree-roots must have jabbed him as the current,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"flung him down. I thought he were dead already, but then he opened up",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,his eyes.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"A funny color they were, greeny yellow. And I swear, Rev'rend, when he",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,opened them eyes I _felt_ he was readin' my mind. I thought maybe he,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,might be one of them circus fellers in their flying contraptions that,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,hang at the bottom of a balloon.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

28650,"Portygee sailor or like those tarnal dumb Frenchies up Canady way,",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"but--well, funny. He said, ""My baby--in ship. Get--baby ..."" He tried to",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,say more but his eyes went shut and he moaned hard.,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,,Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
28650,"I yelped, ""Godamighty!"" 'Scuse me, Rev'rend, but I was so blame upset",Year of the Big Thaw,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,the Darkovans are so superstitious about it. The moons have remarkably,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"eccentric orbits--I don't know anything about that part, I'm quoting Dr.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"weeks I'd spent, broken-bodied and delirious, gently tended by one of",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the red-eyed, twittering women of the trailmen. In all I had spent eight",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"years in the Nest, which was not a nest at all but a vast sprawling city",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,built in the branches of enormous trees. With the small and delicate,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"humanoids who had been my playfellows, I had gathered the nuts and buds",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and trapped the small arboreal animals they used for food, taken my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,share at weaving clothing from the fibres of parasite plants cultivated,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"on the stems, and in all those eight years I had set foot on the ground",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"less than a dozen times, even though I had travelled for miles through",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the tree-roads high above the forest floor.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Then the Old-One's painful decision that I was too alien for them, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the difficult and dangerous journey my trailmen foster-parents and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"foster-brothers had undertaken, to help me out of the Hellers and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,arrange for me to be taken to the Trade City. After two years of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,physically painful and mentally rebellious readjustment to daytime,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"living, the owl-eyed trailmen saw best, and lived largely, by moonlight,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I had found a niche for myself, and settled down. But all of the later",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"years (after Jay Allison had taken over, I supposed, from a basic",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,pattern of memory common to both of us) had vanished into the limbo of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the subconscious.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,A bookrack was crammed with large microcards; I slipped one into the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"viewer, with a queer sense of spying, and found myself listening",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,apprehensively to hear that measured step and Jay Allison's falsetto,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"voice demanding what the hell I was doing, meddling with his",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"possessions. Eye to the viewer, I read briefly at random, something",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"about the management of compound fracture, then realized I had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,understood exactly three words in a paragraph. I put my fist against my,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"forehead and heard the words echoing there emptily; ""laceration ...",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"primary efflusion ... serum and lymph ... granulation tissue...."" I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,presumed that the words meant something and that I once had known what.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"But if I had a medical education, I didn't recall a syllable of it. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,didn't know a fracture from a fraction.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,In a sudden frenzy of impatience I stripped off the white coat and put,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"on the first shirt I came to, a crimson thing that hung in the line of",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,white coats like an exotic bird in snow country. I went back to,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,rummaging the drawers and bureaus. Carelessly shoved in a pigeonhole I,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,found another microcard that looked familiar; and when I slipped it,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,mechanically into the viewer it turned out to be a book on,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"mountaineering which, oddly enough, I remembered buying as a youngster.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It dispelled my last, lingering doubts. Evidently I had bought it before",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the personalities had forked so sharply apart and separated, Jason from",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Jay. I was beginning to believe. Not to accept. Just to believe it had,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"happened. The book looked well-thumbed, and had been handled so much I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,had to baby it into the slot of the viewer.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Under a folded pile of clean underwear I found a flat half-empty bottle,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,of whiskey. I remembered Forth's words that he'd never seen Jay Allison,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"drink, and suddenly I thought, ""The fool!"" I fixed myself a drink and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,me fork so strongly apart ... so strongly that there had been days and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"weeks and, I suspected, years where Jay Allison had kept me prisoner. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"tried to juggle dates in my mind, looked at a calendar, and got such a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,mental jolt that I put it face-down to think about when I was a little,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,drunker.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I wondered if my detailed memories of my teens and early twenties were,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the same memories Jay Allison looked back on. I didn't think so. People,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"forget and remember selectively. Week by week, then, and year by year,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the dominant personality of Jay had crowded me out; so that the young,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rowdy, more than half Darkovan, loving the mountains, half-homesick for",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"a non-human world, had been drowned in the chilly, austere young medical",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"student who lost himself in his work. But I, Jason--I had always been",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the watcher behind, the person Jay Allison dared not be? Why was he past",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,thirty--and I just 22?,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,A ringing shattered the silence; I had to hunt for the intercom on the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"bedroom wall. I said, ""Who is it?"" and an unfamiliar voice demanded,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Dr. Allison?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I said automatically, ""Nobody here by that name,"" and started to put",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"back the mouthpiece. Then I stopped and gulped and asked, ""Is that you,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Dr. Forth?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It was, and I breathed again. I didn't even want to think about what I'd",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,say if somebody else had demanded to know why in the devil I was,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"answering Dr. Allison's private telephone. When Forth had finished, I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"went to the mirror, and stared, trying to see behind my face the sharp",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"features of that stranger, _Doctor_ Jason Allison. I delayed, even while",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I was wondering what few things I should pack for a trip into the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,mountains and the habit of hunting parties was making mental lists about,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,heat-socks and windbreakers. The face that looked at me was a young,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"face, unlined and faintly freckled, the same face as always except that",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I'd lost my suntan; Jay Allison had kept me indoors too long. Suddenly I,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,struck the mirror lightly with my fist.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""The hell with you, Dr. Allison,"" I said, and went to see if he had kept",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"Dr. Forth was waiting for me in the small skyport on the roof, and so",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"was a small 'copter, one of the fairly old ones assigned to Medical",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Service when they were too beat-up for services with higher priority.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Forth took one startled stare at my crimson shirt, but all he said was,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Hello, Jason. Here's something we've got to decide right away; do we",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"tell the crew who you really are?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I shook my head emphatically. ""I'm not Jay Allison; I don't want his",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Tell them I'm his twin brother,"" I said humorlessly.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""That wouldn't be necessary. There's not enough resemblance."" Forth",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,raised his head and beckoned to a man who was doing something near the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"'copter. He said under his breath, ""You'll see what I mean,"" as the man",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,approached.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,He wore the uniform of Spaceforce--black leather with a little rainbow,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,of stars on his sleeve meaning he'd seen service on a dozen different,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"planets, a different colored star for each one. He wasn't a young man,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"but on the wrong side of fifty, seamed and burly and huge, with a split",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,lip and weathered face. I liked his looks. We shook hands and Forth,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"said, ""This is our man, Kendricks. He's called Jason, and he's an expert",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"on the trailmen. Jason, this is Buck Kendricks.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Glad to know you, Jason."" I thought Kendricks looked at me half a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"second more than necessary. ""The 'copter's ready. Climb in, Doc--you're",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"going as far as Carthon, aren't you?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,We put on zippered windbreaks and the 'copter soared noiselessly into,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the pale crimson sky. I sat beside Forth, looking down through pale",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,lilac clouds at the pattern of Darkover spread below me.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Kendricks was giving me a funny eye, Doc. What's biting him?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""He has known Jay Allison for eight years,"" Forth said quietly, ""and he",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"hasn't recognized you yet.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"But we let it ride at that, to my great relief, and didn't talk any more",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"about me at all. As we flew under silent whirring blades, turning our",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"backs on the settled country which lay near the Trade City, we talked",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,about Darkover itself. Forth told me about the trailmen's fever and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"managed to give me some idea about what the blood fraction was, and why",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,it was necessary to persuade fifty or sixty of the humanoids to return,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"with me, to donate blood from which the antibody could be, first",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"isolated, then synthesised.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It would be a totally unheard-of thing, if I could accomplish it. Most",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"of the trailmen never touched ground in their entire lives, except when",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"crossing the passes above the snow line. Not a dozen of them, including",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"my foster-parents who had so painfully brought me out across Dammerung,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,had ever crossed the ring of encircling mountains that walled them away,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,from the rest of the planet. Humans sometimes penetrated the lower,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,forests in search of the trailmen. It was one-way traffic. The trailmen,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,into trailmen country--those mountains profanely dubbed the Hellers by,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the first Terrans who had tried to fly over them in anything lower or,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,slower than a spaceship. (The Darkovan name for the Hellers was even,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"more explicit, and even in translation, unrepeatable.)",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""What about this crew you picked? They're not Terrans?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"Forth shook his head. ""It would be murder to send anyone recognizably",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"""Kendricks knows you,"" Forth said, ""but I'm going to be perfectly",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"truthful. I never knew Jay Allison well, except in line of work. I know",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,a lot of things--from the past couple of days--which came out during,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the hypnotic sessions, which he'd never have dreamed of telling me, or",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"anyone else, consciously. And that comes under the heading of a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"professional confidence--even from you. And for that reason, I'm sending",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Kendricks along--and you're going to have to take the chance he'll,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"and sprawling and squatty, and burned brown with the dust of five",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,at the edge of the city which might once have been a warehouse or a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"ruined palace. Inside there were a couple of trucks, stripped down to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,framework and flatbed like all machinery shipped through space from,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Terra. There were pack animals, dark shapes in the gloom. Crates were",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stacked up in an orderly untidiness, and at the far end a fire was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"burning and five or six men in Darkovan clothing--loose sleeved shirts,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"tight wrapped breeches, low boots--were squatting around it, talking.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"They got up as Forth and Kendricks and I walked toward them, and Forth",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Forth introduced me simply as ""Jason,"" after the Darkovan custom, and I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"looked the men over, one by one. Back when I'd climbed for fun, I'd",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,liked to pick my own men; but whoever had picked this crew must have,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,known his business.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Three were mountain Darkovans, lean swart men enough alike to be",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"brothers; I learned after a while that they actually were brothers,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Hjalmar, Garin and Vardo. All three were well over six feet, and Hjalmar",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stood head and shoulders over his brothers, whom I never learned to tell",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"apart. The fourth man, a redhead, was dressed rather better than the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,others and introduced as Lerrys Ridenow--the double name indicating high,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkovan aristocracy. He looked muscular and agile enough, but his hands",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"were suspiciously well-kept for a mountain man, and I wondered how much",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,experience he'd had.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"of the small sweetish Darkovan cigarettes, looking over the plan",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,somebody had scribbled down on the top of a packing case. I borrowed a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"about blood fractions, but when it came to climbing I knew what I was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,doing. Rafe and Lerrys and the Darkovan brothers crowded behind me to,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"""But you're not going to have it,"" said a voice behind us, a crisp",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"authoritative voice. ""Take off that gun, man!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks and I whirled together, to see the speaker; a tall young",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkovan, still standing in the shadows. The newcomer spoke to me",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,directly:,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""I'm told you are Terran, but that you understand the trailmen. Surely",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"you don't intend to carry fission or fusion weapons against them?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"And I suddenly realized that we were in Darkovan territory now, and that",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,we must reckon with the Darkovan horror of guns or of any weapon which,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,reaches beyond the arm's-length of the man who wields it. A simple,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"heat-gun, to the Darkovan ethical code, is as reprehensible as a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,super-cobalt planetbuster.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks protested, ""We can't travel unarmed through trailmen country!",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,We're apt to meet hostile bands of the creatures--and they're nasty with,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"those long knives they carry!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"The stranger said calmly, ""I've no objection to you, or anyone else,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"carrying a knife for self-defense.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"son-of-a--who do you think you are, anyway?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"The Darkovans muttered. The man in the shadows said, ""Regis Hastur.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,       *       *       *       *       *,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks stared pop-eyed. My own eyes could have popped, but I decided",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"it was time for me to take charge, if I were ever going to. I rapped,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""All right, this is my show. Buck, give me the gun.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"He looked wrathfully at me for a space of seconds, while I wondered what",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I'd do if he didn't. Then, slowly, he unbuckled the straps and handed it",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to me, butt first.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I'd never realized quite how undressed a Spaceforce man looked without,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,his blaster. I balanced it on my palm for a minute while Regis Hastur,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"came out of the shadows. He was tall, and had the reddish hair and fair",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"skin of Darkovan aristocracy, and on his face was some indefinable",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stamp--arrogance, perhaps, or the consciousness that the Hasturs had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ruled this world for centuries long before the Terrans brought ships and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,trade and the universe to their doors. He was looking at me as if he,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"approved of me, and that was one step worse than the former situation.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"So, using the respectful Darkovan idiom of speaking to a superior (which",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"he was) but keeping my voice hard, I said, ""There's just one leader on",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"any trek, Lord Hastur. On this one, I'm it. If you want to discuss",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"whether or not we carry guns, I suggest you discuss it with me in",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"private--and let me give the orders.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,One of the Darkovans gasped. I knew I could have been mobbed. But with a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"mixed bag of men, I had to grab leadership quick or be relegated to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"nowhere. I didn't give Regis Hastur a chance to answer that, either; I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"said, ""Come back here. I want to talk to you anyway.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"He came, and I remembered to breathe. I led the way to a fairly deserted",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"corner of the immense place, faced him and demanded, ""As for you--what",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,are you doing here? You're not intending to cross the mountains with,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"us?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"He met my scowl levelly. ""I certainly am.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I groaned. ""Why? You're the Regent's grandson. Important people don't",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"take on this kind of dangerous work. If anything happens to you, it will",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"be my responsibility!"" I was going to have enough trouble, I was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"thinking, without shepherding along one of the most revered Personages",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,on the whole damned planet! I didn't want anyone around who had to be,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"fawned on, or deferred to, or even listened to.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"He frowned slightly, and I had the unpleasant impression that he knew",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"what I was thinking. ""In the first place--it will mean something to the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trailmen, won't it--to have a Hastur with you, suing for this favor?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,It certainly would. The trailmen paid little enough heed to the ordinary,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"humans, except for considering them fair game for plundering when they",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"came uninvited into trailman country. But they, with all Darkover,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"revered the Hasturs, and it was a fine point of diplomacy--if the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkovans sent their most important leader, they might listen to him.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""In the second place,"" Regis Hastur continued, ""the Darkovans are my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"people, and it's my business to negotiate for them. In the third place,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I know the trailmen's dialect--not well, but I can speak it a little.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"And in the fourth, I've climbed mountains all my life. Purely as an",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"amateur, but I can assure you I won't be in the way.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,There was little enough I could say to that. He seemed to have covered,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"every point--or every point but one, and he added, shrewdly, after a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"minute, ""Don't worry; I'm perfectly willing to have you take charge. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"won't claim--privilege.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkover is a civilized planet with a fairly high standard of living,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,but it is not a mechanized or a technological culture. The people don't,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"do much mining, or build factories, and the few which were founded by",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Terran enterprise never were very successful; outside the Terran Trade,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,While the other men checked and loaded supplies and Rafe Scott went out,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to contact some friends of his and arrange for last-minute details, I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,sat down with Forth to memorize the medical details I must put so,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"absurdly light-hearted. Where I sat, I could raise my head and study the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"panorama of blackish-green foothills which lay beyond Carthon, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"search out the stone roadways, like a tiny white ribbon, which we could",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,follow for the first stage of the trip. Forth evidently did not share my,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,meet the other guide they had chosen.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,And I almost backed out when I saw the guide. For the guide was a woman.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"She was small for a Darkovan girl, and narrowly built, the sort of body",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"that could have been called boyish or coltish but certainly not, at",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"first glance, feminine. Close-cut curls, blue-black and wispy, cast the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"faintest of shadows over a squarish sunburnt face, and her eyes were so",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,thickly rimmed with heavy dark lashes that I could not guess their,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,color. Her nose was snubbed and might have looked whimsical and was,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"instead oddly arrogant. Her mouth was wide, and her chin round, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,altogether I dismissed her as not at all a pretty woman.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"Amazons entered virtually every masculine field, but that of mountain",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"agile enough, her body, under the heavy blanket-like clothing, almost as",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,lean of hip and flat of breast as my own; only the slender long legs,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,were unequivocally feminine.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"decades, had not been planned for any travel other than the feet of men",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,as windows. I jolted awake--what nonsense had I been thinking? Vague,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ideas about evolution swirled in my brain like burst bubbles--the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trailmen? They were just the trailmen, who could explain them? Jay",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Allison, maybe? Rafe turned his head and asked, ""Where do we pull up for",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the night? It's getting dark, and we have all this gear to sort!"" I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"roused myself, and took over the business of the expedition again.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,But when the trucks had been parked and a tent pitched and the pack,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"animals unloaded and hobbled, and a start made at getting the gear",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"together--when all this had been done I lay awake, listening to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks' heavy snoring, but myself afraid to sleep. Dozing in the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"truck, an odd lapse of consciousness had come over me ... myself yet not",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"myself, drowsing over thoughts I did not recognize as my own. If I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"slept, who would I be when I woke?",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"and unbridged; the river Kadarin, traditionally a point of no return for",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,humans on Darkover. The river is fed by ocean tides and we would have to,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"wait for low water to cross. Beyond the river lay thick forests, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"beyond the forests the slopes of the Hellers, rising upward and upward;",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and their every fold and every valley was filled to the brim with,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,But though all this country was thickly populated with outlying colonies,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"From time immemorial, the trailmen--usually inoffensive--had kept strict",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,boundaries marked between their lands and the lands of ground-dwelling,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"men. They never came beyond the Kadarin. On the other hand, almost any",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,for attack.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,A few of the Darkovan mountain people had trade treaties with the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trailmen; they traded clothing, forged metals, small implements, in",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"return for nuts, bark for dyestuffs and certain leaves and mosses for",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"drugs. In return, the trailmen permitted them to hunt in the forest",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"lands without being molested. But other humans, venturing into trailman",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"territory, ran the risk of merciless raiding; the trailmen were not",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"bloodthirsty, and did not kill for the sake of killing, but they",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"attacked in packs of two or three dozen, and their prey would be",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,stripped and plundered of everything portable.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"packing up the last oddments, ready for the saddle, I gave the girl Kyla",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the task of readying the rucksacks we'd carry after the trails got too,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"bad even for the pack animals, and went to stand at the water's edge,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,around with a good deal of horseplay and a certain brisk bustle. They,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"were a good crew, I'd already discovered. Rafe and Lerrys and the three",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkovan brothers were tireless, cheerful and mountain-hardened.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks, obviously out of his element, could be implicitly relied on",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to follow orders, and I felt that I could fall back on him. Strange as",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"it seemed, the very fact that he was a Terran was vaguely comforting,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,where I'd anticipated it would be a nuisance.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,The girl Kyla was still something of an unknown quantity. She was too,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"taut and quiet, working her share but seldom contributing a word--we",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,were not yet in mountain country. So far she was quiet and touchy with,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,alone.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Hi, Jason, get a move on,"" someone shouted, and I walked back toward",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the clearing squinting in the sun. It hurt, and I touched my face",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"gingerly, suddenly realizing what had happened. Yesterday, riding in the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"uncovered truck, and this morning, un-used to the fierce sun of these",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"latitudes, I had neglected to take the proper precautions against",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"exposure and my face was reddening with sunburn. I walked toward Kyla,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"who was cinching a final load on one of the pack-animals, which she did",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,efficiently enough.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"She didn't wait for me to ask, but sized up the situation with one",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"amused glance at my face. ""Sunburn? Put some of this on it."" She",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"produced a tube of white stuff; I twisted at the top inexpertly, and she",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"took it from me, squeezed the stuff out in her palm and said, ""Stand",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"still and bend down your head.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,She smeared the mixture efficiently across my forehead and cheeks. It,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"felt cold and good. I started to thank her, then broke off as she burst",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"out laughing. ""What's the matter?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""You should see yourself!"" she gurgled.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I wasn't amused. No doubt I presented a grotesque appearance, and no",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"doubt she had the right to laugh at it, but I scowled. It hurt.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Intending to put things back on the proper footing, I demanded, ""Did you",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"make up the climbing loads?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""All except bedding. I wasn't sure how much to allow,"" she said. ""Jason,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"have you eyeshades for when you get on snow?"" I nodded, and she",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"instructed me severely, ""Don't forget them. Snowblindness--I give you my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"word--is even more unpleasant than sunburn--and _very_ painful!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Damn it, girl, I'm not stupid!"" I exploded.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"She said, in her expressionless monotone again, ""Then you _ought_ to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"have known better than to get sunburnt. Here, put this in your pocket,""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"she handed me the tube of sunburn cream, ""maybe I'd better check up on",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"some of the others and make sure they haven't forgotten."" She went off",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"without another word, leaving me with an unpleasant feeling that she'd",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"come off best, that she considered me an irresponsible scamp.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Forth had said almost the same thing....,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I told off the Darkovan brothers to urge the pack animals across the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"narrowest part of the ford, and gestured to Corus and Kyla to ride one",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"on either side of Kendricks, who might not be aware of the swirling,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,treacherous currents of a mountain river. Rafe could not urge his edgy,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"horse into the water; he finally dismounted, took off his boots, and led",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the creature across the slippery rocks. I crossed last, riding close to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Regis Hastur, alert for dangers and thinking resentfully that anyone so",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,important to Darkover's policies should not be risked on such a mission.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Why, if the Terran Legate had (unthinkably!) come with us, he would be",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"surrounded by bodyguards, secret service men and dozens of precautions",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"against accident, assassination or misadventure.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"All that day we rode upward, encamping at the furthest point we could",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,travel with pack animals or mounted. The next day's climb would enter,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the dangerous trails we must travel afoot. We pitched a comfortable,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"camp, but I admit I slept badly. Kendricks and Lerrys and Rafe had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,blinding headaches from the sun and the thinness of the air; I was more,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"used to these conditions, but I felt a sense of unpleasant pressure, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"my ears rang. Regis arrogantly denied any discomfort, but he moaned and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"cried out continuously in his sleep until Lerrys kicked him, after which",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"he was silent and, I feared, sleepless. Kyla seemed the least affected",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,of any; probably she had been at higher altitudes more continuously than,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,any of us. But there were dark circles beneath her eyes.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"However, no one complained as we readied ourselves for the final last",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"long climb upward. If we were fortunate, we could cross Dammerung before",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"nightfall; at the very least, we should bivouac tonight very near the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,pass. Our camp had been made at the last level spot; we partially,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"hobbled the pack animals so they would not stray too far, and left ample",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"food for them, and cached all but the most necessary of light trail",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"gear. As we prepared to start upward on the steep, narrow track--hardly",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"more than a rabbit-run--I glanced at Kyla and stated, ""We'll work on",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rope from the first stretch. Starting now.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"One of the Darkovan brothers stared at me with contempt. ""Call yourself",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"a mountain man, Jason? Why, my little daughter could scramble up _that_",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"track without so much as a push on her behind!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I set my chin and glared at him. ""The rocks aren't easy, and some of",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,these men aren't used to working on rope at all. We might as well get,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"used to it, because when we start working along the ledges, I don't want",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"anybody who doesn't know how.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"They still didn't like it, but nobody protested further until I directed",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the huge Kendricks to the center of the second rope. He glared viciously,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"at the light nylon line and demanded in some apprehension, ""Hadn't I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,better go last until I know what I'm doing? Hemmed in between the two of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"you, I'm apt to do something damned dumb!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Hjalmar roared with laughter and informed him that the center place on a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"3-man rope was always reserved for weaklings, novices and amateurs. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,expected Kendricks' temper to flare up: the burly Spaceforce man and the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkovan giant glared at one another, then Kendricks only shrugged and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,knotted the line through his belt. Kyla warned Kendricks and Lerrys,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"about looking down from ledges, and we started.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"The first stretch was almost too simple, a clear track winding higher",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and higher for a couple of miles. Pausing to rest for a moment, we could",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,turn and see the entire valley outspread below us. Gradually the trail,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"grew steeper, in spots pitched almost at a 50-degree angle, and was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"scattered with gravel, loose rock and shale, so that we placed our feet",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"carefully, leaning forward to catch at handholds and steady ourselves",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"against rocks. I tested each boulder carefully, since any weight placed",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,against an unsteady rock might dislodge it on somebody below. One of the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Darkovan brothers--Vardo, I thought--was behind me, separated by ten or",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"twelve feet of slack rope, and twice when his feet slipped on gravel he",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,stumbled and gave me an unpleasant jerk. What he muttered was perfectly,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"true; on slopes like this, where a fall wasn't dangerous anyhow, it was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,better to work unroped; then a slip bothered no one but the slipper.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,But I was finding out what I wanted to know--what kind of climbers I had,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,to lead through the Hellers.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Along a cliff face the trail narrowed horizontally, leading across a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,foot-wide ledge overhanging a sheer drop of fifty feet and covered with,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"loose shale and scrub plants. Nothing, of course, to an experienced",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,climber--a foot-wide ledge might as well be a four-lane superhighway.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks made a nervous joke about a tightrope walker, but when his",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"turn came he picked his way securely, without losing balance. The",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"amateurs--Lerrys Ridenow, Regis, Rafe--came across without hesitation,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,but I wondered how well they would have done at a less secure altitude;,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to a real mountaineer, a footpath is a footpath, whether in a meadow,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"above a two-foot drop, a thirty-foot ledge, or a sheer mountain face",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,three miles above the first level spot.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"After crossing the ledge the going was harder. A steeper trail, in",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"places nearly imperceptible, led between thick scrub and overhanging",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trees, thickly forested. In spots their twisted roots obscured the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,trail; in others the persistent growth had thrust aside rocks and dirt.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,We had to make our way through tangles of underbrush which would have,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"been nothing to a trailman, but which made our ground-accustomed bodies",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ache with the effort of getting over or through them; and once the track,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"was totally blocked by a barricade of tangled dead brushwood, borne down",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,on floodwater after a sudden thaw or cloud-burst. We had to work,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"painfully around it over a three-hundred-foot rockslide, which we could",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"cross only one at a time, crab-fashion, leaning double to balance",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ourselves; and no one complained now about the rope.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Toward noon I had the first intimation that we were not alone on the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,slope.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,At first it was no more than a glimpse of motion out of the corner of my,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"eyes, the shadow of a shadow. The fourth time I saw it, I called softly",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to Kyla: ""See anything?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Look for a spot where we can take a break,"" I directed. We climbed",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"along a shallow ledge, the faint imperceptible flutters in the brushwood",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"climbing with us on either side. I muttered to the girl, ""I'll be glad",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,when we get clear of this. At least we'll be able to see what's coming,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"after us!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"""Rapids!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I pulled myself up to the edge of the drop and stood looking down into,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the narrow gully. Here the narrow track we had been following was,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"crossed and obscured by the deep, roaring rapids of a mountain stream.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Less than twenty feet across, it tumbled in an icy flood, almost a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"waterfall, pitching over the lip of a crag above us. It had sliced a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"ravine five feet deep in the mountainside, and came roaring down with a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,rushing noise that made my head vibrate. It looked formidable; anyone,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stepping into it would be knocked off his feet in seconds, and swept a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,thousand feet down the mountainside by the force of the current.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,It did. I remembered the trail and remembered the spot. Kendricks joined,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"me at the water's edge, and asked, ""How do we get across?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""I'm not sure,"" I said, studying the racing white torrent. Overhead,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"about twenty feet from where we clustered on the slope, the thick",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"branches of enormous trees overhung the rapids, their long roots",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"partially bared, gnarled and twisted by recurrent floods; and between",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"these trees swayed one of the queer swing-bridges of the trailmen,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,hanging only about ten feet above the water.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Even I had never learned to navigate one of these swing-bridges without,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,assistance; human arms are no longer suited to brachiation. I might have,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"managed it once; but at present, except as a desperate final expedient,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"it was out of the question. Rafe or Lerrys, who were lightly built and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"acrobatic, could probably do it as a simple stunt on the level, in a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"field; on a steep and rocky mountainside, where a fall might mean being",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"dashed a thousand feet down the torrent, I doubted it. The trailmen's",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,bridge was out ... but what other choice was there?,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I beckoned to Kendricks, he being the man I was the most inclined to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trust with my life at the moment, and said, ""It looks uncrossable, but I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"think two men could get across, if they were steady on their feet. The",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"others can hold us on ropes, in case we do get knocked down. If we can",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"get to the opposite bank, we can stretch a fixed rope from that snub of",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rock--"" I pointed, ""and the others can cross with that. The first men",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"over will be the only ones to run any risk. Want to try?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I liked it better that he didn't answer right away, but went to the edge",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"of the gully and peered down the rocky chasm. Doubtless, if we were",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"knocked down, all seven of the others could haul us up again; but not",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,before we'd been badly smashed on the rocks. And once again I caught,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,that elusive shadow of movement in the brushwood; if the trailmen chose,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"a moment when we were half-in, half-out of the rapids, we'd be",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ridiculously vulnerable to attack.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""We ought to be able to get a fixed rope easier than that,"" Hjalmar",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"said, and took one of the spares from his rucksack. He coiled it, making",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"a running loop on one end, and standing precariously on the lip of the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rapids, sent it spinning toward the outcrop of rock we had chosen as a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"fixed point. ""If I can get it over....""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"The rope fell short, and Hjalmar reeled it in and cast the loop again.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"He made three more unsuccessful tries before finally, with held breath,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"we watched the noose settle over the rocky snub. Gently, pulling the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"line taut, we watched it stretch above the rapids. The knot tightened,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,fastened. Hjalmar grinned and let out his breath.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""There,"" he said, and jerked hard on the rope, testing it with a long",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"hard pull. The rocky outcrop broke, with a sharp crack, split, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"toppled entirely into the rapids, the sudden jerk almost pulling Hjalmar",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"off his feet. The boulder rolled, with a great bouncing splash, faster",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and faster down the mountain, taking the rope with it.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"We just stood and stared for a minute. Hjalmar swore horribly, in the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"unprintable filth of the mountain tongue, and his brothers joined in.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""How the devil was I to know the _rock_ would split off?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Better for it to split now than when we were depending on it,"" Kyla",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"said stolidly. ""I have a better idea."" She was untying herself from the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rope as she spoke, and knotting one of the spares through her belt. She",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"handed the other end of the rope to Lerrys. ""Hold on to this,"" she said,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and slipped out of her blankety windbreak, standing shivering in a thin",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"sweater. She unstrapped her boots and tossed them to me. ""Now boost me",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"on your shoulders, Hjalmar.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Too late, I guessed her intention and shouted, ""No, don't try--!"" But",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,she had already clambered to an unsteady perch on the big Darkovan's,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,shoulders and made a flying grab for the lowest loop of the trailmen's,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"bridge. She hung there, swaying slightly and sickeningly, as the loose",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,lianas gave to her weight.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Hjalmar--Lerrys--haul her down!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""I'm lighter than any of you,"" Kyla called shrilly, ""and not hefty",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"enough to be any use on the ropes!"" Her voice quavered somewhat as she",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"added, ""--and hang on to that rope, Lerrys! If you lose it, I'll have",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"done this for nothing!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"She gripped the loop of vine and reached, with her free hand, for the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,next loop. Now she was swinging out over the edge of the boiling rapids.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Tight-mouthed, I gestured to the others to spread out slightly",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,below--not that anything would help her if she fell.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Hjalmar, watching as the woman gained the third loop--which joggled",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"horribly to her slight weight--shouted suddenly, ""Kyla, quick! The loop",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"_beyond_--don't touch the next one! It's frayed--rotted through!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Kyla brought her left hand up to her right on the third loop. She made a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"long reach, missed her grab, swung again, and clung, breathing hard, to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the safe fifth loop. I watched, sick with dread. The damned girl should",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,have told me what she intended.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kyla glanced down and we got a glimpse of her face, glistening with the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"mixture of sunburn cream and sweat, drawn with effort. Her tiny swaying",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"figure hung twelve feet above the white tumbling water, and if she lost",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"her grip, only a miracle could bring her out alive. She hung there for a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"minute, jiggling slightly, then started a long back-and-forward swing.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,On the third forward swing she made a long leap and grabbed at the final,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,loop.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,It slipped through her fingers; she made a wild grab with the other,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"hand, and the liana dipped sharply under her weight, raced through her",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"fingers, and with a sharp snap, broke in two. She gave a wild shriek as",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"it parted, and twisted her body frantically in mid-air, landing asprawl",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"half-in, half-out of the rapids, but on the further bank. She hauled her",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"legs up on dry land and crouched there, drenched to the waist but safe.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"hurt?"" She indicated in pantomime that the thundering of the water",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"drowned words, and bent to belay her end of the rope. In sign-language I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"gestured to her to make very sure of the knots; if anyone slipped, she",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,hadn't the weight to hold us.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,Kendricks and I stepped into the water.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It was even icier than I expected, and my first step was nearly the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"last; the rush of the white water knocked me to my knees, and I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,floundered and would have measured my length except for my hands on the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"fixed rope. Buck Kendricks grabbed at me, letting go the rope to do it,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and I swore at him, raging, while we got on our feet again and braced",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ourselves against the onrushing current. While we struggled in the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"pounding waters, I admitted to myself; we could never have crossed",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,without the rope Kyla had risked her life to fix.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Shivering, we got across and hauled ourselves out. I signalled to the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"Regis and Hjalmar came struggling across last; Regis, lightly-built, was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"swept off his feet and Hjalmar turned to grab him, but I shouted to him",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,to keep clear--they were still roped together and if the ropes fouled we,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,might drown someone. Lerrys and I leaped down and hauled Regis clear; he,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"coughed, spitting icy water, drenched to the skin.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I motioned to Lerrys to leave the fixed rope, though I had little hope",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"that it would be there when we returned, and looked quickly around,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,debating what to do. Regis and Rafe and I were wet clear through; the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"others to well above the knee. At this altitude, this was dangerous,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,although we were not yet high enough to worry about frostbite. Trailmen,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"or no trailmen, we must run the lesser risk of finding a place where we",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,could kindle a fire and dry out.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"It was hard climbing now, on rock, and there were places where we had to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"scrabble for handholds, and flatten ourselves out against an almost",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"sheer wall. The keen wind rose as we climbed higher, whining through the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"thick forest, soughing in the rocky outcrops, and biting through our",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"soaked clothing with icy teeth. Kendricks was having hard going now, and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I helped him as much as I could, but I was aching with cold. We gained",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the clearing, a small bare spot on a lesser peak, and I directed the two",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Darkovan brothers who were the driest to gather dry brushwood and get a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,fire going. It was hardly near enough sunset to camp; but by the time we,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"were dry enough to go on safely, it would be, so I gave orders to get",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the tent up, then rounded angrily on Kyla.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,me as Kyla's plain sullen face glowed under the praise from the Hastur.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,The fact was--I admitted it grudgingly--a lightweight like Kyla ran less,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,risk on an acrobat's bridge than in that kind of roaring current. That,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"did not lessen my annoyance; and Regis Hastur's interference, and the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"foolish grin on the girl's face, made me boil over.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I wanted to question her further about the sight of trailmen on the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"bridge, but decided against it. We had been spared attack on the rapids,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"so it wasn't impossible that a group, not hostile, was simply watching",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,our progress--maybe even aware that we were on a peaceful mission.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,But I didn't believe it for a minute. If I knew anything about the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trailmen, it was this--one could not judge them by human standards at",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"all. I tried to decide what I would have done, as a trailman, but my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,brain wouldn't run that way at the moment.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,The Darkovan brothers had built up the fire with a thoroughly reckless,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,disregard of watching eyes. It seemed to me that the morale and fitness,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,of the shivering crew was of more value at the moment than caution; and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"around the roaring fire, feeling my soaked clothes warming to the blaze",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and drinking boiling hot tea from a mug, it seemed that we were right.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Optimism reappeared; Kyla, letting Hjalmar dress her hands which had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"been rubbed raw by the slipping lianas, made jokes with the men about",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,her feat of acrobatics.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,We had made camp on the summit of an outlying arm of the main ridge of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the Hellers, and the whole massive range lay before our eyes, turned to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"a million colors in the declining sun. Green and turquoise and rose, the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,mountains were even more beautiful than I remembered. The shoulder of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the high slope we had just climbed had obscured the real mountain massif,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"from our sight, and I saw Kendricks' eyes widen as he realized that this",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,high summit we had just mastered was only the first step of the task,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"which lay before us. The real ridge rose ahead, thickly forested on the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"lower slopes, then strewn with rock and granite like the landscape of an",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"airless, deserted moon. And above the rock, there were straight walls",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"capped with blinding snow and ice. Down one peak a glacier flowed, a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"waterfall, a cascade shockingly arrested in motion. I murmured the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trailman's name for the mountain, aloud, and translated it for the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"climbed or ever will be climbed, we're not going to climb it now!"" He",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stared at me and added, ""I hope!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""We're not."" I was glad of the interruption. If the youngsters and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"unclimbable sierras, that was all very well, but it was, if nothing",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"worse, a great waste of time. I showed Kendricks a notch in the ridge,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"something scrabbling up my back. I whirled and ripped the creature away,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and saw dimly that the clearing was filled to the rim with an explosion,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"of furry white bodies. I cupped my hands and yelled, in the only",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trailman dialect I knew, ""Hold off! We come in peace!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,One of them yelled something unintelligible and plunged at me--another,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"ugly knife--a female! I ripped out my own knife, fending away a savage",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,slash. Something tore white-hot across the knuckles of my hand; the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"fingers went limp and my knife fell, and the trailman woman snatched it",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"up and made off with her prize, swinging lithely upward into the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,treetops.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I searched quickly, gripped with my good hand at the bleeding knuckles,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and found Regis Hastur struggling at the edge of a ledge with a pair of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,the creatures. The crazy thought ran through my mind that if they killed,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,him all Darkover would rise and exterminate the trailmen and it would,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"all be my fault. Then Regis tore one hand free, and made a curious",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,motion with his fingers.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It looked like an immense green spark a foot long, or like a fireball.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,It exploded in one creature's white face and she gave a wild howl of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"terror and anguish, scrabbled blindly at her eyes, and with a despairing",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"shriek, ran for the shelter of the trees. The pack of trailmen gave a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"long formless wail, and then they were gathering, flying, retreating",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,into the shadows. Rafe yelled something obscene and then a bolt of,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,bluish flame lanced toward the retreating pack. One of the humanoids,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"fell without a cry, pitching senseless over the ledge.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I ran toward Rafe, struggling with him for the shocker he had drawn from",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""They'd have killed him without it,"" he retorted wrathfully. He had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,evidently failed to see how efficiently Regis defended himself. Rafe,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"motioned toward the fleeing pack and sneered, ""Why don't you go with",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,pitched it over the ledge.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"Garin was blinking senselessly, half-dazed by a blow; Regis' forehead",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"had been gashed and dripped blood, and Hjalmar's thigh sliced in a clean",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,cut. My own knuckles were laid bare and the hand was getting numb. It,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"was a little while before anybody noticed Kyla, crouched over speechless",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,with pain. She reeled and turned deathly white when we touched her; we,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stretched her out where she was, and got her shirt off, and Kendricks",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"shut his eyes briefly, wondering if he were having one of his worst",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"He motioned away the crowding strangers and said in his bad Darkovan,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"""Buck, get these people away, give the patient some air. Where's my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"injured was a woman, and young.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,The wound was only a superficial laceration; whatever sharp instrument,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"had inflicted it, had turned on the costal bone without penetrating lung",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"tissue. It could have been sutured, but Kendricks handed him only a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,badly-filled first-aid kit; so Dr. Allison covered it tightly with a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"plastic clip-shield which would seal it from further bleeding, and let",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"it alone. By the time he had finished, the strange girl had begun to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"stir. She said haltingly, ""Jason--?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"spoke swiftly to the girl, in one of the Darkovan languages Jay didn't",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"understand, and then drew Jay aside, out of earshot. He said in a shaken",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,sleep in a comfortably closed-in office and waking up on a cliff at the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,outer edges of nowhere. His hand hurt; he saw that it was bleeding and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"flexed it experimentally, trying to determine that no tendons had been",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"""Kyla's all right,"" Regis said, but I got up quickly to make sure. Kyla",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"was outside, lying quite comfortably on a roll of blankets. She was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"propped on her elbow drinking something hot, and there was a good smell",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"of hot food in the air. I stared at Regis and demanded, ""I didn't conk",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"out, did I, from a little scratch like this?"" I looked carelessly at my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,gashed hand.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Wait--"" Regis held me back, ""don't go out just yet. Do you remember",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"what happened, Doctor Allison?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I stared in growing horror, my worst fear confirmed. Regis said quietly,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""You--changed. Probably from the shock of seeing--"" he stopped in",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"mid-sentence, and I said, ""The last thing I remember is seeing that Kyla",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"was bleeding, when we got her clothes off. But--good Gods, a little",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"blood wouldn't scare _me_, and Jay Allison's a surgeon, would it bring",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"him roaring up like that?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""I couldn't say."" Regis looked as if he knew more than he was telling.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""I don't believe that Dr. Allison--he's not much like you--was very",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"concerned with Kyla. Are you?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Damn right I am. I want to make sure she's all right--"" I stopped",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"abruptly. ""Regis--did they all see it?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Only Kendricks and I,"" Regis said, ""and we will not speak of it.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I said, ""Thanks,"" and felt his reassuring hand-clasp. Damn it, demigod",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"or prince, I _liked_ Regis.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I went out and accepted some food from the kettle and sat down between,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kyla and Kendricks to eat. I was shaken, weak with reaction.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Furthermore, I realized that we couldn't stay here. It was too",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"vulnerable to attack. So, in our present condition, were we. If we could",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"push on hard enough to get near Dammerung pass tonight, then tomorrow we",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"could cross it early, before the sun warmed the snow and we had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"snowslides and slush to deal with. Beyond Dammerung, I knew the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,tribesmen and could speak their language.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I mentioned this, and Kendricks looked doubtfully at Kyla. ""Can she",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"climb?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Can she stay here?"" I countered. But I went and sat beside her anyhow.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""How badly are you hurt? Do you think you can travel?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"She said fiercely, ""Of course I can climb! I tell you, I'm no weak girl,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I'm a free Amazon!"" She flung off the blanket somebody had tucked around",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"her legs. Her lips looked a little pinched, but the long stride was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,steady as she walked to the fire and demanded more soup.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,We struck the camp in minutes. The trailmen band of raiding females had,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"snatched up almost everything portable, and there was no sense in",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,striking and caching the tent; they'd return and hunt it out. If we came,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"back with a trailmen escort, we wouldn't need it anyway. I ordered them",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to leave everything but the lightest gear, and examined each remaining",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rucksack. Rations for the night we would spend in the pass, our few",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"remaining blankets, ropes, sunglasses. Everything else I ruthlessly",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,ordered left behind.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It was harder going now. For one thing, the sun was lowering, and the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"evening wind was icy. Nearly everyone of us had some hurt, slight in",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"itself, which hindered us in climbing. Kyla was white and rigid, but did",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,not spare herself; Kendricks was suffering severely from mountain,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"sickness at this altitude, and I gave him all the help I could, but with",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,my stiffening slashed hand I wasn't having too easy a time myself.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"There was one expanse that was sheer rock-climbing, flattened like bugs",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"against a wall, scrabbling for hand-holds and footholds. I felt it a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"point of pride to lead, and I led; but by the time we had climbed the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"thirty-foot wall, and scrambled along a ledge to where we could pick up",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the trail again, I was ready to give over. Crowding together on the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"ledge, I changed places with the veteran Lerrys, who was better than",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,most professional climbers.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"He muttered, ""I thought you said this was a _trail_!""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,I stretched my mouth in what was supposed to be a grin and didn't quite,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"make it. ""For the trailmen, this is a superhighway. And no one else ever",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"comes this way.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Now we climbed slowly over snow; once or twice we had to flounder,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"through drifts, and once a brief bitter snowstorm blotted out sight for",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"twenty minutes, while we hugged each other on the ledge, clinging wildly",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,against wind and icy sleet.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"We bivouacked that night in a crevasse blown almost clean of snow, well",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"above the tree-line, where only scrubby unkillable thornbushes",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"clustered. We tore down some of them and piled them up as a windbreak,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and bedded beneath it; but we all thought with aching regret of the,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,comfort of the camp gear we'd abandoned. The going had gotten good and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,rough.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,That night remains in my mind as one of the most miserable in memory.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Except for the slight ringing in my ears, the height alone did not",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"bother me, but the others did not fare so well. Most of the men had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"blinding headaches, Kyla's slashed side must have given her considerable",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"pain, and Kendricks had succumbed to mountain-sickness in its most",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,agonizing form: severe cramps and vomiting. I was desperately uneasy,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"about all of them, but there was nothing I could do; the only cure for",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"mountain-sickness is oxygen or a lower altitude, neither of which was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,practical.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"In the windbreak we doubled up, sharing blankets and body warmth: I took",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"a last look around the close space before crawling in beside Kendricks,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and saw the girl bedding down slightly apart from the others. I started,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"to say something, but Kendricks spoke, first. Voicing my thoughts.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Better crawl in with us, girl."" He added, coldly but not unkindly, ""you",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"needn't worry about any funny stuff.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kyla gave me just the flicker of a grin, and I realized she was",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,including me on the Darkovan side of a joke against this big man who was,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,so unaware of Darkovan etiquette. But her voice was cool and curt as she,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"said, ""I'm not worrying,"" and loosened her heavy coat slightly before",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,creeping into the nest of blankets between us.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"It was painfully cramped, and chilly in spite of the self-heating",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,blankets; we crowded close together and Kyla's head rested on my,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"shoulder. I felt her snuggle closely to me, half asleep, hunting for a",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"warm place; and I found myself very much aware of her closeness,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"curiously grateful to her. An ordinary woman would have protested, if",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"only as a matter of form, sharing blankets with two strange men. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"realized that if Kyla had refused to crawl in with us, she would have",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,called attention to her sex much _more_ than she did by matter-of-factly,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"behaving as if she were, in fact, male.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"She shivered convulsively, and I whispered, ""Side hurting? Are you",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"cold?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""A little. It's been a long time since I've been at these altitudes,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks coughed, moving uncomfortably. ""I don't understand--those",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"creatures who attacked us--all women--?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I explained briefly. ""Among the people of the Sky, as everywhere, more",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,females are born than males. But the trailmen's lives are so balanced,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,that they have no room for extra females within the Nests--the cities.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"So when a girl child of the Sky People reaches womanhood, the other",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"women drive her out of the city with kicks and blows, and she has to",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,wander in the forest until some male comes after her and claims her and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"brings her back as his own. Then she can never be driven forth again,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,although if she bears no children she can be forced to be a servant to,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"his other wives.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Kendricks made a little sound of disgust.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""You think it cruel,"" Kyla said with sudden passion, ""but in the forest",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,they can live and find their own food; they will not starve or die. Many,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"of them prefer the forest life to living in the Nests, and they will",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,fight away any male who comes near them. We who call ourselves human,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"often make less provision for our spare women.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"She was silent, sighing as if with pain. Kendricks made no reply except",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,a non-committal grunt. I held myself back by main force from touching,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kyla, remembering what she was, and finally said, ""We'd better quit",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"talking. The others want to sleep, if we don't.""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"After a time I heard Kendricks snoring, and Kyla's quiet even breaths. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,wondered drowsily how Jay would have felt about this situation--he who,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"hated Darkover and avoided contact with every other human being, crowded",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,between a Darkovan free-Amazon and half a dozen assorted roughnecks. I,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"turned the thought off, fearing it might somehow re-arouse him in his",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,brain.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"But I had to think of something, anything to turn aside this",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"consciousness of the woman's head against my chest, her warm breath",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,coming and going against my bare neck. Only by the severest possible act,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"of will did I keep myself from slipping my hand over her breasts, warm",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and palpable through the thin sweater, I wondered why Forth had called",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,me undisciplined. I couldn't risk my leadership by making advances to,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"our contracted guide--woman, Amazon or whatever!",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Somehow the girl seemed to be the pivot point of all my thoughts. She,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"was not part of the Terran HQ, she was not part of any world Jay Allison",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"might have known. She belonged wholly to Jason, to my world. Between",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"sleep and waking, I lost myself in a dream of skimming flight-wise along",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"the tree roads, chasing the distant form of a girl driven from the Nest",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,that day with blows and curses. Somewhere in the leaves I would find her,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"... and we would return to the city, her head garlanded with the red",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"leaves of a chosen-one, and the same women who had stoned her forth",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,would crowd about and welcome her when she returned. The fleeing woman,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,looked over her shoulder with Kyla's eyes; and then the woman's form,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"muted and Dr. Forth was standing between us in the tree-road, with the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,caduceus emblem on his coat stretched like a red staff between us.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Kendricks in his Spaceforce uniform was threatening us with a blaster,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and Regis Hastur was suddenly wearing Space Service uniform too and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"saying, ""Jay Allison, Jay Allison,"" as the tree-road splintered and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,cracked beneath our feet and we were tumbling down the waterfall and,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,down and down and down....,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"""Wake up!"" Kyla whispered, and dug an elbow into my side. I opened my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"hard, in the dim light, and the trail not difficult here. After all the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"trouble on the lower slopes, I think even the amateurs had lost their",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"raging. When this was over, I'd suddenly realized, I wouldn't be there.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"I wouldn't be anywhere. I was a surrogate, a substitute, a splinter of",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Jay Allison, and when it was over, Forth and his tactics would put me",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,back into what they considered my rightful place--which was nowhere. I'd,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"never climb a mountain except now, when we were racing against time and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"necessity. I set my mouth in an unaccustomed narrow line and said,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"behind, we saw what looked like a great green carpet, interspersed with",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"with a rheumatic complaint of some sort, their reddish eyes bleared and",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rheumy. They welcomed me, and made arrangements for the others in my",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"The first thing to be done was to despatch a messenger to the Old One,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,with green branches after the Darkovan custom for the dead. The other,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"He said, ""You've done enough, Jay. You've worked like the devil.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Thurmond--the Legate--sent down to say you'd get an official,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"All through the work of isolating and testing the blood fraction, Jay",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"had worked tirelessly and unsparingly; scarcely sleeping, but brooding;",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"silent, prone to fly into sudden savage rages, but painstaking. He had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,overseen the trailmen with an almost fatherly solicitude--but from a,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,distance. He had left no stone unturned for their comfort--but refused,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,to see them in person except when it was unavoidable.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Forth thought, we played a dangerous game. Jay Allison had made his own",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"adjustment to life, and we disturbed that balance. Have we wrecked the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"man? He's expendable, but damn it, what a loss! He asked, ""Well, why",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Jay did not answer. He had avoided Kendricks, the only witness to his",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"duality. In all his nightmare brooding, the avoidance of anyone who had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"known him as Jason became a mania. Once, meeting Rafe Scott on the lower",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"floor of the HQ, he had turned frantically and plunged like a madman",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"through halls and corridors, to avoid coming face to face with the man,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,finally running up four flights of stairs and taking shelter in his,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"rooms, with the pounding heart and bursting veins of a hunted criminal.",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"""Ask him, why don't you. Look, Forth, I don't much care to see him. I",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,didn't do it for Darkover; I did it because it was my job. I'd prefer to,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"forget the whole thing. Why don't you talk to him?""",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"this one."" Forth sat down beside the desk. Jay struck the woodwork with",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,a violent clenched fist and when he lowered his hand there was a tiny,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,smear of blood along his knuckles. After a minute he walked to the couch,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"and sat down, very straight and stiff, saying nothing. Neither of the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"men spoke again until Forth started at the sound of a buzzer, drew the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"mouthpiece toward him, and said, ""Tell him we are honored--you know the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"Jay twisted his fingers together and ran his thumb, in a new gesture,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,over the ridge of scar tissue along the knuckles. Forth was aware of an,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"entirely new quality in the silence, and started to speak to break it,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"but before he could do so, the office door slid open on its silent beam,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,and Regis Hastur stood there.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,Forth rose courteously and Jay got to his feet like a mechanical doll,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"to meet you again, sir. I hope that our gratitude to you will soon take",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,to my lips and sipped. Regis took his hand away from his throat and said,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"a sure sense of identity, that I was Doctor Jason Allison, Jr., who had",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,abandoned mountain climbing and become a specialist in Darkovan,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"been at his throat. Jay or Jason, maddened by self-hate and jealousy,",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,could disclaim responsibility for the other's acts.,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,"extended his hand, and after a minute, I understood, and we shook hands",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"briefly, like strangers who have just met. He added, ""Your work with the",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

31619,of the Terrans our science--matrix mechanics. Dr. Allison--Jason--you,The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
31619,"know Darkover, and I think we could work with you. Further, you know",The Planet Savers,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"in my ears as the eagle started away with flapping, angry wings--then,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in fury, swept down at me, pinions beating around my head. I heard and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"felt the wicked beak dart in, and thrust blindly upward with the knife,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ripped, slashing, hearing the bird's scream of pain and the flapping of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,wide wings. A red haze spun around me--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Then the screaming eagle was gone and Andy's angry grip was on my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shoulder, shaking me roughly. His voice, furious and frightened, was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hardly recognizable. ""Mike! Mike, you darned idiot, are you all right?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"You must be crazy!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I blinked, rubbing my hand across my eyes. The hand came away wet. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was standing in the clearing, the knife in my hand red with blood. Bird",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"blood. I heard myself ask, stupidly, ""What happened?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"My brother's face came clear out of the thickness in my mind, scowling",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wrathfully. ""You tell _me_ what happened! Mike, what in the devil",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were you thinking about? You told me yourself that an eagle will attack,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a man if he's bothered. I had him square in the camera when you jumped,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,out of there like a bat out of a belfry and went for the eagle with,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"your knife! You must be clean crazy!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I let the knife drop out of my hand. ""Yeah--"" I said heavily, ""Yeah,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I guess I spoiled your picture, Andy. I'm sorry--I didn't--"" my voice",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"trailed off, helpless. The boy's hand was still on my shoulder; he let",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"it drop and knelt in the grass, groping there for his camera. ""That's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"all right, Mike,"" he said in a dead voice, ""you scared the daylights",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"out of me, that's all."" He stood up swiftly, looking straight into my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face. ""Darn it, Mike, you've been acting crazy for a week! I don't mind",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the blamed camera, but when you start going for eagles with your bare",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hands--"" abruptly he flung the camera away, turned and began to run",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,down the slope in the direction of the cabin.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I took a step to follow, then stopped, bending to retrieve the broken",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,pieces of Andy's cherished camera. The kid must have hit the eagle with,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"it. Lucky thing for me; an eagle can be a mean bird. But why, why in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the living hell had I done a thing like that? I'd warned Andy time,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and time again to stay clear of the big birds. Now that the urgency,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of action had deserted me, I felt stupid and a little lightheaded. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,didn't wonder Andy thought I was crazy. I thought so myself more than,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"half the time. I stowed the broken camera in my tackle box, mentally",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"promising Andy a better one; hunted up the abandoned lines and poles,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"carefully stowed them, cleaned our day's catch. It was dark before I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,started for the cabin; I could hear the hum of the electric dynamo I'd,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,rigged up and see the electric light across the dusk of the Sierras. A,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,smell of bacon greeted me as I crossed into the glare of the unshielded,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"bulb. Andy was standing at the cookstove, his back stubbornly to me. He",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,did not turn.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"second mug of coffee, he got up and began to walk around the room,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"restlessly. ""Mike--"" he said entreatingly, ""you came here for a rest!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Why can't you lay off your everlasting work for a while and relax?"" He",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,looked disgustedly over his shoulder at the work table where the light,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"spilled over a confused litter of wires and magnets and coils. ""You've",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"it when they threw me out of the government lab, just after the big",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"Now that the war's over, it's no military secret, and I'll tell you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"what happened.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I paused, swallowing down the coffee, not knowing that it scalded my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mouth. ""That is--I will if I can.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Six months before they settled the war in Korea, I was working in a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"government radio lab, on some new communications equipment. Since I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"never finished it, there's no point in going into details; it's enough",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to say it would have made radar as obsolete as the stagecoach. I'd,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"built a special supersonic condenser, and had had trouble with a set",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of magnetic coils that wouldn't wind properly. When the thing blew up,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I hadn't had any sleep for three nights, but that wasn't the reason. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was normal then; just another communications man, intent on radio and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,this new equipment and without any of the crazy impractical notions,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that had lost me my job later. They called it overwork, but I knew they",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,thought the explosion had disturbed my brain. I didn't blame them. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,would have liked to think so.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,It started one day in the lab with a shadow on the sun and an elusive,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,short circuit that gave me shock after shock until I was jittery. By,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the time I had it fixed, the oscillator had gone out of control. I got",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a series of low-frequency waves that were like nothing I'd ever seen,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,before. Then there was something like a voice speaking out of a very,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"old, jerry-built amateur radio set. Except that there wasn't a receiver",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in the lab, and no one else had heard it. I wasn't sure myself, because",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,right then every instrument in the place went haywire and five minutes,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"later, part of the ceiling hit the floor and the floor went up through",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the roof. They found me, they say, lying half-crushed under a beam, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I woke up eighteen hours later in a hospital with four cracked ribs,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and a feeling as if I'd had a lot of voltage poured into me. It went in,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the report that I'd been struck by lightning.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,It took me a long time to get well. The ribs healed fast--faster,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"than the doctor liked. I didn't mind the hospital part, except",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that I couldn't walk without shaking, or light a cigarette without",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"burning myself, for months. The thing I minded was what I remembered",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,_before_ I woke up. Delirium; that was what they told me. But,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the _kind_ and _type_ of scars on my body didn't ring true.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Electricity--even freak lightning--doesn't make that kind of burns. And,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,my corner of the world doesn't make a habit of branding people.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But before I could show the scars to anybody outside the hospital, they",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were gone. Not healed; just gone. I remembered the look on the medic's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,face when I showed him the place where the scars had been. He didn't,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,think I was crazy; he thought _he_ was.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I knew the lab hadn't been struck by lightning. The Major knew it,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,too; I found that out the day I reported back to work. All the time,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"we talked, his big pen moved in stubby circles across the page of his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"log-book, and he talked without raising his head to look at me.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I know all that, Kenscott. No electrical storms reported in the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"grew stubborn, ""the lab was wrecked and you were hurt. We've got to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"have something for the record.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I could understand all that. What I resented was the way they treated,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,me after I went back to work. They transferred me to another division,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and another line of work. They turned down my request to follow up,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,those nontypical waves. My private notes were ripped out of my notebook,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,while I was at lunch and I never saw them again. And as soon as they,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"could, they shipped me to Fairbanks, Alaska, and that was the end of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"""I'd let it alone, Kenscott. No sense stirring up more trouble. We",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"you might get your head blown off, not just a dose of stray voltage",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,out of the blue. We've done everything but stand on our heads trying,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to find out where that spare energy came from--and where it went. But,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"we've marked that whole line of research _closed_, Kenscott. If I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,think that was funny either. But there was relief on his face as I left,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,The armistice had hardly been signed when they sent me back to the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,States with a recommendation of overwork. I tried to explain it to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Andy. ""They said I needed a rest. Maybe so. The shock did something",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,Ordinary radio work doesn't mean anything to me any more. It doesn't,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,make sense. When people out west were talking about flying saucers or,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,whatever they were--and when they talked about weather disturbances,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"Where had the intangible part of me been, those eighteen hours when",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I first lay crushed under a fallen beam, then under morphine in the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hospital? Where had those scars come from? More important, what had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,made a radio lab blow up in the first place? Electricity sets fires; it,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shocks men into insensibility or death. It doesn't explode. Radio waves,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"are in themselves harmless. Most important of all, what maniac freak of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,lightning was I carrying in my body that made me immune to electrical,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,the electric dynamo in the cellar and taken the whole voltage in my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,body. I was still alive. It would have been a hell of a way to commit,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,suicide--but I hadn't.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"Either I was crazy or there was something wrong; in any case, sitting",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"here wouldn't help. If it didn't let up, I'd take the first train home",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and see a good electrician--or a psychiatrist. But right now, I was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,with a phosphorescent glow as the entire house current poured into my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"""Narayan is the Dreamer,"" the tired voice said. ""He is the Dreamer, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,where the Dreamer walks he will know. But have it your way. I am very,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"old and it does not matter. I give you this power, freely--to spare",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you. But Gamine--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Gamine--"" the second voice stopped. After a long time, ""You are old,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and a fool, Rhys,"" it said. ""What is Gamine to me?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Bodiless, blind, I drifted and swayed and swung in the sound of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"voices. The humming, like a million high-tension wires, sang around",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,me and I felt myself cradled in the pull of a great magnet that,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,held me suspended surely on nothingness and drew me down into the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,field of some force beneath. Far below me the voices faded. I swung,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"free--fell--plunged downward in sickening motion, head over heels, into",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the abyss....,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,My feet struck hard flooring. I wrenched back to consciousness with a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,jolt. Winds blew coldly in my face; the cabin walls had been flung back,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to the high-lying stars. I was standing at a barred window at the very,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"pinnacle of a tall tower, in the lap of a weird blueness that arched",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flickeringly in the night. I caught a glimpse of a startled face, a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lean tired old face beneath a peaked hood, in the moment before my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knees gave way and I fell, striking my head against the bars of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,window.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I was lying on a narrow, high bed in a room filled with doors and bars.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I could see the edge of a carved mirror set in a frame, and the top",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of a chest of some kind. On a bench at the edge of my field of vision,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"there were two figures sitting. One was the old grey man, hunched",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wearily beneath his robe, wearing robes like a Tibetan Lama's, somber",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"black, and a peaked hood of grey. The other was a slimmer younger",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"figure, swathed in silken silvery veiling, with a thin opacity where",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the face should have been, and a sort of opalescent shine of flesh",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,through the silvery-sapphire silks. The figure was that of a boy or a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"slim immature girl; it sat erect, motionless, and for a long time I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"studied it, curious, between half-opened lids. But when I blinked, it",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,rose and passed through one of the multitudinous doors; at once a soft,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sibilance of draperies announced return. I sat up, getting my feet to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the floor, or almost there; the bed was higher than a hospital bed. The",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"blue-robe held a handled mug, like a baby's drinking-cup, at me. I took",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,it in my hand hesitated--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Neither drug nor poison,"" said the blue-robe mockingly, and the voice",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was as noncommittal as the veiled body; a sexless voice, soft alto, a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"woman's or a boy's. ""Drink and be glad it is none of Karamy's brewing.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I tasted the liquid in the mug; it had an indeterminate greenish look,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and a faint pungent taste I could not identify, although it reminded me",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,variously of anise and garlic. It seemed to remove the last traces of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shock. I handed the cup back empty and looked sharply at the old man in,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the Lama costume.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""You're--Rhys?"" I said. ""Where in hell have I gotten to?"" At least,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that's what I meant to say. Imagine my surprise when I found myself,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"asking--in a language I'd never heard, but understood perfectly--""To",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"which of the domains of Zandru have I been consigned now?"" At the same",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,moment I became conscious of what I was wearing. It seemed to be an,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"old-fashioned nightshirt, chopped off at the loins, deep crimson in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"color. ""Red flannels yet!"" I thought with a gulp of dismay. I checked",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,my impulse to get out of bed. Who could act sane in a red nightshirt?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""You might have the decency to explain where I am,"" I said. ""If you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"know.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The tiredness seemed part of Rhys voice. ""Adric,"" he said wearily. ""Try",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to remember."" He shrugged his lean shoulders. ""You are in your own",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Tower. And you have been under restraint again. I am sorry."" His voice",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sounded futile. I felt prickling shivers run down my backbone. In spite,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of the weird surroundings, the phrase ""under restraint"" had struck",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,home. I was a lunatic in an asylum.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The blue-robed one cut in in that smooth, sexless, faint-sarcastic",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"voice. ""While Karamy holds the amnesia-ray, Rhys, you will be",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,explaining it to him a dozen times a cycle. He will never be of use,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to us again. This time Karamy won. Adric; try to remember. You are at,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"home, in Narabedla.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"I shook my head. Nightshirt or no nightshirt, I'd face this on my feet.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I walked to Rhys; put my clenched hands on his shoulders. ""Explain",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,this! Who am I supposed to be? You called me Adric. I'm no more Adric,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric, you are not amusing!"" The blue-robe's voice was edged with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"anger. ""Use what intelligence you have left! You have had enough",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_sharig_ antidote to cure a _tharl_. Now. Who are you?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The words were meaningless. I stared, trapped. I clung to hold on to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"identity. ""Adric--"" I said, bewildered. That was my name. Was it?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Wasn't it? No. I was Mike Kenscott. Hang on to that. Two and two are,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,four. The circumference equals the radius squared times pi. Four rulls,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,1954. Army serial number 13-48746. Karamy. I cradled my bursting head,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in my hands. ""I'm crazy. Or you are. Or we're both sane and this",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"very far on the Time Ellipse, Gamine. Adric, try to understand. This",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was Karamy's work. She sent you out on a time line, far, very far into",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I will."" A hint of emotion flickered in the voice of Gamine. ""Go,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Master.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Rhys left the room, through one of the doors. Gamine turned impatiently",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to me again. ""We waste time this way. Fool, look at yourself!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I strode to a mirror that lined one of the doors. Above the crimson,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,nightshirt I saw a face--not my own. The sight rocked my mind. Out of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the mirror a man's face looked anxiously; a face eagle-thin, darkly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"moustached, with sharp green eyes. The body belonging to the face that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was _not_ mine was lean and long and strongly muscled--and not,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,quite human. I squeezed my eyes shut. This couldn't be--I opened my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,eyes. The man in the red nightshirt I was wearing was still reflected,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,there.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I turned my back on the mirror, walking to one of the barred windows",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to look down on the familiar outline of the Sierra Madre, about a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,hundred miles away. I couldn't have been mistaken. I knew that ridge,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of mountains. But between me and the mountains lay a thickly forested,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,expanse of land which looked like no scenery I had ever seen in my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,life. I was standing near the pinnacle of a high tower; I dimly saw the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"curve of another, just out of my line of vision. The whole landscape",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was bathed in a curiously pinkish light; through an overcast sky I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"could just make out, dimly, the shadowy disk of a watery red sun.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Then--no, I wasn't dreaming, I really did see it--beyond it, a second",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sun; blue-white, shining brilliantly, pallid through the clouds, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,brighter than any sunlight I had ever seen.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,It was proof enough for me. I turned desperately to Gamine behind me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Where have I gotten, to? Where--_when_ am I? Two suns--those",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mountains--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The change in Gamine's voice was swift; the veiled face lifted,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,questioningly to mine. What I had thought a veil was not that; it,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,seemed to be more like a shimmering screen wrapped around the features,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"so that Gamine was faceless, an invisible person with substance but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"no apprehensible characteristics. Yes, it was like that; as if there",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was an invisible person wearing the curious silken draperies. But the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,invisible flesh was solid enough. Hands like cold steel gripped my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shoulders. ""You have been back? Back to the days before the second sun?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric, tell me; did Earth truly have but one sun?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Wait--"" I begged. ""You mean I've travelled in time?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The exultation faded from Gamine's voice imperceptibly. ""Never mind. It",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"is improbable in any case. No, Adric; not really travelling. You were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"only sent out on the Time Ellipse, till you contacted some one in that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,other Time. Perhaps you stayed in contact with his mind so long that,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you think you are he?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I'm not Adric--"" I raged. ""Adric sent me here--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I saw the blurring around Gamine's invisible features twitch in a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"headshake. ""It's never been proven that two minds can be interchanged",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"like that. Adric's body. Adric's brain. The brain convolutions, the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"memory centers, the habit patterns--you'd still be Adric. The idea that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,you are someone else is only an illusion of your conscious mind. It,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"will wear off.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I shook my head, puzzled. ""I still don't believe it. Where am I?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine moved impatiently. ""Oh, very well. You are Adric of Narabedla;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and if you are sane again, Lord of the Crimson Tower. I am Gamine.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The swathed shoulders moved a little. ""You don't remember? I am a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"spell-singer.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I jerked my elbow toward the window. ""Those are my own mountains out",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"there,"" I said roughly. ""I'm not Adric, whoever he is. My name's Mike",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"and let me see your face.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I wish you meant that--"" a mournfulness breathed in the soft",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"contralto. A sudden fury blazed up in me from nowhere. ""And what right",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"have you to pry for that old fool Rhys? Get back to your own place,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"then, spell-singer--"" I broke off, appalled. What was I saying? Worse,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,what did I mean by it? Gamine turned. The sexless voice was coldly,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"amused. ""Adric spoke then. Whoever sits in the seat of your soul, you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"are the same--and past redemption!"" The robes whispered sibilantly on",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the floor as Gamine moved to the door. ""Karamy is welcome to her slave!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The door slammed.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Left alone, I flung myself down on the high bed, stubbornly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"concentrating on Mike Kenscott, shutting out the vague blurred mystery",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in my mind that was Adric impinging on consciousness. I was not Adric.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I would _not_ be. I dared not go to the window and look out at the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"terrifying two suns, even to see the reassurance of the familiar Sierra",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Madre skyline. A homesick terror was hurting in me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But persistently the Adric memories came, a guilty feeling of a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shirked duty, and a frightened face--a real face, not a blurred",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,nothingness--beneath Gamine's blue veils. Memories of strange hunts and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a big bird on the pommel of a high saddle. A bird hooded like a falcon,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in crimson.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Consciousness of dress made me remember the--nightshirt--I still wore.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Moving swiftly, without conscious thought, I went to a door and slid",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,it open; pulled out some garments and dressed in them. Every garment,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in the closet was the same color; deep-hued crimson. I glanced in the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,mirror and a phrase Gamine had used broke the surface of my mind like,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a leaping fish. ""Lord of the Crimson Tower."" Well, I looked it. There",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"had been knives and swords in the closet; I took out one to look at it,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and before I realized what I was doing I had belted it across my hip. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stared, decided to let it remain. It looked all right with the rest of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the costume. It felt right, too. Another door folded back noiselessly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and a man stood looking at me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,He was young and would have been handsome in an effeminate way if his,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face had not been so arrogant. Lean, somehow catlike, it was easy to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"determine that he was akin to Adric, or me, even before the automatic",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"habit of memory fitted name and identity to him. ""Evarin,"" I said,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,warily.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He came forward, moving so softly that for an uneasy moment I wondered",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,if he had pads like a cat's on his feet. He wore deep green from head,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to foot, similar to the crimson garments that clothed me. His face had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a flickering, as if he could at a moment's notice raise a barrier of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,invisibility like Gamine's about himself. He didn't look as human as I.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I have seen Gamine,"" he said. ""She says you are awake, and as sane as",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,you ever were. We of Narabedla are not so strong that we can afford to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"waste even a broken tool like you.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Wrath--Adric's wrath--boiled up in me; but Evarin moved lithely,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"backward. ""I am not Gamine,"" he warned. ""And I will not be served like",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine has been served. Take care.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Take care yourself,"" I muttered, knowing little else I could have",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said. Evarin drew back thin lips. ""Why? You have been sent out on the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Time Ellipse till you are only a shadow of yourself. But all this is,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"beside the point. Karamy says you are to be freed, so the seals are off",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"all the doors, and the Crimson Tower is no longer a prison to you. Come",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and go as you please. Karamy--"" his lips formed a sneer. ""If you call",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_that_ freedom!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I said slowly, ""You think I'm not crazy?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin snorted. ""Except where Karamy is concerned, you never were. What",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,is that to me? I have everything I need. The Dreamer gives me good,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hunting and slaves enough to do my bidding. For the rest, I am the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Toymaker. I need little. But you--"" his voice leaped with contempt,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""you ride time at Karamy's bidding--and your Dreamer walks--waiting the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"coming of his power that he may destroy us all one day!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I stared somberly at Evarin, standing still near the door. The words",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,seemed to wake an almost personal shame in me. The boy watched and his,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face lost some of his bitterness. He said more quietly, ""The falcon",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flown cannot be recalled. I came only to tell you that you are free.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He turned, shrugging his thin shoulders, and walked to the window. ""As",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I say, if you call that freedom.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I followed him to the window. The clouds were clearing; the two suns,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shone with a blinding brilliance. By looking far to the left I could,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"see a line of rainbow-tinted towers that rose into the sky, tall and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"capped with slender spires. I could distinguish five clearly; one, the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"nearest, seemed made of a jewelled blue; one, clear emerald green;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"golden, flame-colored, violet. There were more beyond, but the colors",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were blurred and dim. They made a semicircle about a wooded park;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,beyond them the familiar skyline of the mountains tugged old memories,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in my brain. The suns swung high in a sky that held no tint of blue,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that was as clear and colorless as ice. Abruptly I turned my back on it,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"all. Evarin murmured, ""Narabedla. Last of the Rainbow Cities. Adric--how",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"long now?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I did not answer. ""Karamy wants me?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Evarin's laugh was only a soundless shaking of his thin shoulders.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Karamy can wait. Better for you if she waited forever. Come along with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me, or Gamine will be back. You don't want to see Gamine, do you?"" He",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sounded anxious; I shook my head. Emphatically, I did _not_ want",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to see that insidious spook again. ""No. Why? Should I?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin looked relieved. ""Come along, then. If I know Gamine, you're",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"pretty well muddled. Amnesiac. I'll explain. After all--"" his voice",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mocked, ""you _are_ my brother!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,He thrust open the door and motioned me through. Instinctively I drew,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"back, gesturing him to lead the way; he laughed soundlessly and went,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and I followed, letting it slide shut behind me.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"We went down stairs and more stairs. I walked at Evarin's side, one",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,part of me wondering why I was not more panicky. I was a stranger in a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"world gone insane, yet I had that outrageous calmness with which men",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,do fantastic things in a dream. I was simply taking one step after,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,another; knowing what to do with that part of me that was Adric. Gamine,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"had spoken of habit patterns, the convolutions of the brain. I had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric's body. Only a superficial me, an outer ego, was still a strange,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,muddled Mike Kenscott. The subconscious Adric was guiding me. I let him,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,ride. I felt it would be wise to be very much Adric around Evarin. We,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stepped into an elevator shaft which went down, curved around corners",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"with a speed that threw me against the wall, then began, slowly, to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,rise. I had long since lost all sense of direction. Abruptly the door,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of the shaft opened and we began to walk along a long, brilliantly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,illuminated passage. From somewhere we heard singing; a voice somewhere,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in the range of a trained boy's voice or a woman's mature contralto.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine's voice. I could make no sense of the words; but Evarin halted,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to listen, swearing in a whisper. I thought the faraway voice sang my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"name and Evarin's, but I could not tell. ""What is it, Evarin?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He gave a short exclamation, the sense of which was lost on me.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Come along,"" he said irritably, ""It is only the spell-singer, singing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"old Rhys back to sleep. You waked him this time, did you not? I wonder",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine permitted it. He is very near his last sleep--old Rhys. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"think you will send him there soon."" Without giving me a chance to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"answer--and for that matter, I had no answer ready--he pulled me aside",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,between recessed walls and again the shaft in which we stood began to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ride. Eventually we stepped into a room at the top of another tower, a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"room lavishly, even garishly furnished. Evarin flung himself carelessly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,on a divan embroidered in silken purple and gestured me to follow his,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"example. ""Well, now tell me. Where in Time has Karamy sent you now?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Karamy?"" I asked tentatively. Evarin's raucous laugh rang out again.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He said with seeming irrelevance, but with an odd air of confiding, ""My",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,one demand of the Dreamer is--freedom from that witch's spells. Some,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,day I shall fashion a Toy for her. I am not the Toymaker of Narabedla,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"for nothing. I demand little enough of the Dreamers, Zandru knows! I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"do not like to pay their price, but Karamy does not care what she pays.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"So--"" he made a spreading movement of his hands, ""she has power over",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"everyone, except me. Yes; assuredly I must make her a Toy. She sent you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"out on the Time Ellipse. I wonder who brought you back?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I shook my head. ""I've been out of my body too long. I can't remember",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"much.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""You remember me,"" Evarin said. ""I wonder why she left you that?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Karamy's amnesia-rays took the rest of your memory. She never trusted,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me that far before.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,But I caught the crafty look in his face. I knew only this about,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin; Karamy was right not to trust him. I said, ""I only remember your",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"name. Nothing more.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Because Evarin--I knew--was never ten minutes the same. He would,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"profess friendship and mean friendship; ten minutes later, still in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"friendship, he would flay the skin from my body and count it only an",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,exquisite joke. I did not like those perverted and subtle eyes. He,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"seemed to read my thought. ""Good, we will be strangers. Brothers are",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"too--"" he let the word trail off, unfinished. ""What have you forgotten?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Could I trust him with my terrible puzzlement? How much could I, as",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Adric--and I _must_ be Adric to him--get along without knowing?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"What was even more to the point, how many questions could I dare ask",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"without betraying my own helplessness? I compromised. ""What are the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Dreamers?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,That _had_ been the wrong question.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Zandru. Adric, you have been far indeed! You must have been back",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"before the Cataclysm! Well--our forefathers, after the Cataclysm,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,ruled this planet and built the Rainbow Cities. That was before the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Compact that killed machines. Some people say the Dreamers were born,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"from the dead machines.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"""They are born from men and women. Mendel knows what caused them. But",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,came out of the Cataclysm; some say they are the souls of the dead,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Machines. They are human--and not human. They were telepaths. They,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"could control everything--things, minds, people. They could throw",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"in Rainbow City, a dozen generations ago, found a way to bind the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Dreamers,"" he said. ""We could not kill them; they were deathless,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"normally. But we could bind them in sleep. As they slept, under a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"forced stasis, we could make them give up their powers--to us. So that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"we controlled the things _they_ controlled. For a price."" There",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was a glimpse of horror behind his eyes. ""You know the price. It is",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"high.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He shivered a little, shook his head and the horror vanished. ""So each",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of us has a Dreamer of his own who can grant him power to do as he,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wills. And after years and years, as the Dreamers grow old, they grow",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mortal. They can be killed. And fewer are born, now; fewer to each",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"generation. As they grow older and weaker, it is safe to let them wake;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"I turned my back on the window. ""Rhys is a Dreamer,"" I said with slow",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"certainty. ""What is Gamine?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin nodded slowly, ignoring the question. ""Rhys is a Dreamer, yes.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He is old--so old he is almost mortal now; so he wakes, and he too",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,walks. But he was one of us once--the only Dreamer ever born within the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Rainbow City. His loyalty is double; but he will never harm Narabedla,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"because he is of our blood."" Evarin cleared his throat. ""So Gamine",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"takes what knowledge can be had from his old, old mind. And does not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"pay.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Who is Gamine?"" I asked again. Evarin still hesitated.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Karamy hates Gamine,"" he said, after minutes. ""So no man sees Gamine's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,face. I would not ask too many questions--unless you ask them of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy."" A smile flickered on the mobile features. ""Ask Karamy,"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said gleefully, ""She will tell!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""She will?"" I said stupidly, because I could think of nothing else to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"say. Evarin's grin was delicately malicious. ""Oh, I am sure of that!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy is quick to strike. Gamine and I have little love lost, but we",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,agree on one thing; that Karamy's procession of slaves is monstrous.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,And that you are a fool to help Karamy pay for her--desires. Karamy is,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"far too fond of power in her own hands, to pay to put it into yours.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Karamy. Karamy who took my memory--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""She did."" Evarin murmured, and I realized I had spoken aloud. The room",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,seemed full of a weighty silence. Evarin's prowling footsteps made no,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"noise as he came to my side. ""I can give it back to you, though. I have",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"made you a Toy."" His effete voice rather disgusted me, and I moved",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"away, but he followed. ""Look here, and find your memory.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,And he put something small and hard into my hand; something wrapped in,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,silvery silks.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I raised my hand curiously, untwisting the wrappings. They were smooth",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and shining and colorless, with a bluish cast, like Gamine's veils;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,no fabric I had ever seen. Evarin backed slowly away from me. For an,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,instant all I could see was a blurred invisibility--like Gamine's face,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,behind the veils--then a sort of mirror became slowly visible. It did,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"not seem to reflect anything; rather, it was a coldly shining surface,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cloudy, glittering from within. I bent to examine the pattern of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shadows that moved on the surface. There was a curious pull from the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mirror, a cold that crept sluggishly from my hand. A familiar, soothing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cold. As if drawn by a magnet, my eyes bent closer--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Recognition crashed in my mind. Evarin--and his gilt deadly Toys.... I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"dashed the colorless thing to the floor, giving it a savage kick. The",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,blurred invisibility wavered; I caught a glimpse of a tiny jewelled,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mechanism, before it sprang back to gray ice again. Evarin had backed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"halfway across the room; I leaped at him, collaring the dandy and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wrenching him close. ""I've a good mind to tie the thing across your",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"throat!"" I grated.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Evarin's lip twisted up. Suddenly his whole face melted in a blurring,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,invisibility and I felt his whole substance evaporate from between,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"my hands. He writhed like smoke, and I leaped backward just as he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"materialized, whole and deadly, too close. ""I am always--guarded!"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"jerked out at me, ""I might have known--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He stooped, reaching for the fallen toy. I kicked the little mirror",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"out of his reach, bent to retrieve it. ""I'll keep this,"" I said, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wadding the insulated silk around it, I thrust it into a pocket.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin's eyes glared at me helplessly. ""You'll stay solid for awhile",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"now,"" I jeered. ""_Toymaker!_ Damned freak--"" I stormed out of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"room, leaving him rubbing his bruised shoulder.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Now that Adric was back in control, I had no trouble discovering",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,where I wanted to go. Some blind instinct led me through the maze,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of elevators and staircases; I stepped into servant's quarters,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"kitchens, a roomful of buzzing machinery I dismissed with a glance of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"familiarity; and finally found myself in the open, the semicircle of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,rainbow towers around me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Overhead the suns, red and white, sent a curious, double-shadowed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"light downward through the neatly-trimmed trees. A little day moon,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"smaller than any moon I had known, peeped, a curious crescent, over the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"edge of a mountain. The grass under my feet was just grass, but the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,brightly-tinted flowers in mathematically regular beds were strange to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me. Paths, bordered by narrow ditches to keep the pedestrian off the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flowers, wandered in and out of this strange pleasaunce; I accepted all",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"this without conscious thought, but some unconscious scrap of memory",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,gave me a vague practical reason for the ditches. I carefully avoided,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,them.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Faint shrill music tugged siren-like at my ears; wordless, like",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine's crooning. Staring, I realized that the flowers themselves",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sang. The singing flowers of Karamy's garden--I remembered their lotus,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,song. A song of welcome? Or of danger?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I was not alone in the garden. Men, kilted and belted in the same gaudy",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"red and gold as the flowers, passed and repassed restlessly, unquiet",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,as chained flames. For a moment the old vanity turned upper-most in my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mind. For all her slaves, all her--lovers, Karamy paid tribute to the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Lord of the Crimson Tower! Paid--would continue to pay!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The men passed me, silent. They were sworded, but their swords were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"blunt, like children's toys; they were a regiment of corpses, of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"zombies. Their salutes as I passed were jerky, mechanical.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"A high note sang suddenly in the flowers; I felt, not heard, their",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,empty parading cease. In a weird ballet they ranged themselves into,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"blind lines that filed away nowhere; toy soldiers, all alike.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"And between the backs of the toy-soldiers and the patterned, painted",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flowers, I saw a man running. Another me, from another world, thought",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"briefly of the card-soldiers, flat on their faces in the Red Queen's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"garden. Wonderland. I heard myself say, with half-conscious amusement,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""They all look so alike until you turn them over!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The man running between the ditched flower-beds was no dummy from a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"pack of cards. I saw him beckon, still running. He called to me; to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Adric.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric! Karamy walks here--just listen to the flowers! I was afraid",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I'd have to get all the way into the tower to find you!"" His voice was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"urgent, breathless; he slid to a stop not three feet from me. ""Narayan",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,_knew_ they'd freed you! He's outside the gates. He sent me to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"help. Come on!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The sight of the man touched another of those live-wires in my brain;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the name of _Narayan_, another still. ""Narayan--"" I said in dull",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"recognition. The word, on my lips, hit a chord of fear, of dread and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,danger--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,But I had come straight from Evarin. I knew the man; I knew the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"response he expected, but the brief glimpse into Evarin's mirror had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,set up a chain of actions I could not control. I tried to put out my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hand in friendly greeting; instead I felt, with horror, my fingers",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"at my belt and tried, without success, to halt the sword that flew",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"without volition from its sheath. The man backed away, his eyes full",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of terror. ""Adric--no--the Sign--"" he held up one arm, deprecatingly,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"then howled with agony, clutching the severed fingers. I heard my own",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"voice, savage, inhuman, the thin laughter of Evarin snarling through",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"it. ""Sign?? There's a sign for you!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The man threw himself out of range; but his face, convulsed with pain,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"held a stunned bewilderment. ""Adric--Narayan promised--you were sane--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,he breathed.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I forced my sword back into the scabbard, staring without comprehension",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"at the blood from the wound I had inflicted, and at the darting heads",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of the flowers. I could not kill this man who carried the name of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan on his tongue.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The flowers twitched--stirred--threw tendrils at the man's bleeding,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,hand. A quick nausea tightened my throat; I motioned urgently to him.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Run!"" I begged, ""Quick, or I can't--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The flowers shrilled. The man threw back his head, his eyes wide with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"panic, and screamed.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Karamy! Aiiieeeee--!"" he staggered back wildly, teetering on the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"edge of the ditch. I cried another warning, incoherent--but too",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,late. He trod on the flowers--stumbled across the little ditch. The,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,writhing flower-heads shot up shoulder-high. They screamed a wild,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"paean of flower-music, and he fell among them, sprawling, floundering",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"helplessly. I heard him scream, hoarsely, horribly--I turned my eyes",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"away. There was a wild thrashing, a flailing, a yell that died and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,echoed among the brilliant towers. There was a sort of purring murmur,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from the blossoms.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Then the flowers stilled and were quiet, waving innocently behind their",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,ditches.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy, gold and fire, walked along the winding path through the trees.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,And in the space of a second I forgot the man who lay lifeless in the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,bed of the terrible flowers.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Karamy was all gold. From her glowing crown of hair to the tips of her,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"little slippers, she was one sunny shimmer; there was amber on her",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"brows and at her throat, and an amber rod twisted lightly between her",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fingers, its delicate movement outlining my face. Karamy's smile of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,welcome was a dream which made me know I could be well content if this,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were my world.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But old habit made me turn my face away; her eyes, cat-eyes of wide",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"yellow, watched me slyly, but her face was turned to the sprawled man",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in the flowers. ""So? I thought I heard--something."" Without taking her",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"eyes from my face, she spun the lucent rod. The flower-song rose again,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a soft keening wail. Two of the silent guards moved noiselessly through,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the garden, and at an expressive movement of the rod, they lifted the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,corpse and bore it away. The music died. The woman's hands went out to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,pull me close.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric, Adric! As soon as you are free, they pursue you! That is not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"what you want, is it?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Isn't it?"" I asked shortly. I still could not look full at the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cat-eyes, the caressing face. A memory scuttled, rabbit-fashion, across",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"my mind, giving name and identity to the man I had betrayed to the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,flowers.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy slid in front of me so I had to look at her, and the lovely lazy",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"voice murmured the name I was beginning to know. ""You are angry,"" the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"soft voice caressed me, ""I knew it was not right to let Evarin near",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you! Adric, we need you, Narabedla needs you! We felt betrayed when",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you left us, when you shut yourself up alone with your stars! Have you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"forgotten, or are you still--my lover?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"It rang phony! Phony, was the way I put it to myself. Part of me felt",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"like calling her a lying she-devil and having that much, at least, on",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,record. But I was fast acquiring a double cunning. The animal cunning,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of Adric's old habit--and a desperate, trapped cunning of my own, born",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of a desperate fear of this unfamiliar world. There was nothing I could,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,do except ride on the surface and let my hunches take me where they,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,would. Karamy was very soft and sweet and something more than lovely,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in my arms and I held her crushingly close while I struggled with a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,memory. Who was Karamy? Who--and what--was I?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Karamy dropped her arms. The mantle of lazy seductiveness dropped with,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"them. She spoke with eager annoyance. ""You are still angry because",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I sent you on the Time Ellipse! You do not know it was for your own,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"good--you haven't learned your lesson yet--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,That talk meant danger for me. I could think of only one way to silence,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,it. She seemed to like it; but even with her lips acquiescent under,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mine, I was wary. Was I fooling her--or was she only playing my own",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"game, and playing it a little better?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Now we can make plans,"" she said a little later, ""First, Gamine.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"She looked sharply at me, but I kept my face expressionless. ""Gamine",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,is always with the old Dreamer; she lets him wake; he will grow too,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,strong. We must send Rhys away from Narabedla. Gamine may stay or,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"follow him to exile. But Rhys must go.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Her eyes smoldered. ""Yes, and my Dreamer shall serve you as well, till",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"then!"" She breathed. ""I will pay to put power in your hands!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The very phrase Evarin had used! A shudder stung me briefly.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Her glowing face burned through my sting of fear. ""I go to the Dreamer",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"this night, Adric! Ride with me, and he shall lead you where the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Dreamer walks--and lead you back to power! I have said enough--"" the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"She had, and too much. For I knew now how the Dreamer must be paid. And",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the small part of me that was still Mike Kenscott cowered; the rest of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,me accepted the memory with a shrug. It was this Adric part that spoke.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"Afterward, when I had found my way back to the Crimson Tower, I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,searched for hours for something that might give a clue to Adric's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,mystifying past. I was puzzled about this Adric who came and went as he,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,pleased in the chambers of my memory. But I found nothing; whoever had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stolen Adric's memory, had made sure that nothing in his surroundings",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,should clear up the puzzle in his mind. I knew only one thing. Adric,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was feared, disliked, distrusted by all the Narabedlans, and all except",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine had something to gain by feigning friendship. I could not decide,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,whether Karamy's attitude was love that pretended contempt to mold,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric, or me, to her will, or contempt that pretended love for the same",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"reason. And although habit found affection for Evarin, I could not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,trust him long. Trust a cyclone sooner than that half-mad effeminate!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The name, _Narayan_, stuck burr-like in my mind. Friend, or enemy?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I sat at the barred window of Adric's high room, trying to force memory",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from the alien mind in which I was prisoner. And whether it was sheer,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"effort of will, or the result of the fragmentary look in Evarin's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mirror, or whether, as Gamine insisted, I was really Adric and Mike",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Kenscott was a mere superficial illusion of my conscious mind, memory",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,did begin to pulse back.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,In the early days....,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"In the early days, before the vagueness came on my mind, I, Adric of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the Crimson Tower, had been a power in the Rainbow City. The memories",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of that time were not the kind Mike Kenscott would have cared to own,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"but I, as Adric, found them vastly pleasing. Unlike Gamine, who loved",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"only knowledge, or Evarin, who toyed with pleasure and trickery, I had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wanted power. I had it, unlimited, from a Dreamer who stirred only",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,vaguely in sleep. Half the known portions of this world had known the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Crimson Tower as lord. And Karamy--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Some memories were triumphant. Some were humorous in Adric's cynical,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,mind. Some were terrible beyond guessing--for Adric had not counted,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cost, and even he shuddered from the price the Dreamer had exacted.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Then, to this wilful and wild man, something had happened. I had no",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"idea what; Karamy had reached that far back and blurred, though not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"entirely erased, my memory. It had something to do with a blond boy's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face, lifted in incredulous terror--or joy; and a fleeing form, veiled,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that retreated down the long corridor of my mind, averting its face",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"as I followed. Whatever had happened, it had come when Adric was sick",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"with blood and horror, when he was surfeited, even if momentarily, with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"conquest, and sickened at the price the Dreamer extorted. The power,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"forced through the mind of the Dreamer, called for energy; kinetic",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"energy, available from one source and one only. Adric had fed the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Dreamer with that power. For a while.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"One day, as a whim, I had redeemed a young woman slave--then the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"vagueness came and choked me. I might think; I might burst my brain,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,but so far and no farther my memories would carry me. I _could,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"not_ force memory of that chain of events. But after that, Adric's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,reign had collapsed like the unstable arch it had been. His armies,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"scattered, and he had shut himself up or been imprisoned in his Tower;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"his memories had been stolen and he had gone, or been sent, spinning",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"along a time line forward, or perhaps back, until somewhere in the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,abyss of time he touched Mike Kenscott.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"It had been then, perhaps, that Adric had escaped. He had reached,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,drawn Mike Kenscott back--and switched the two. It was a perfect escape,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from a life Adric had come to hate.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But I _was_ Adric. There was an explanation for that, too. The",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,physical body could not make the transit in time. I had Adric's body;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the convolutions of his brain, the synaptic links of habit. His memory",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"banks. Only the Ego, the super-imposed pattern of the conscious",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"identity, insisted I was Mike Kenscott. In Adric's body, the old",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"patterns ruled, and to all intents and purposes, I _was_ Adric.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"And back in my own time, I thought, Adric was living in my body--living",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Mike Kenscott's life, going through the motions, with only the same",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"queer lapses I was making here. And after a while, even these would",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stop. I was wholly trapped. Here, living Adric's life, the part of me",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that was Adric would grow stronger and stronger till--he?--unseated the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"other identity wholly. And he, in my body? Andy, I thought with a wild",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"swift fear, _what will he do to Andy_?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Nothing. He could not hurt Andy--not in my pattern--any more than I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,could hate Evarin. Or could he?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I had to get back! God, I _had_ to get back!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,When the white sun had set and the red sun glowed a darkening ember,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"across the Sierra, a summons came, brought by one of Karamy's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"toy-soldier cohorts. I dressed--in crimson again, for there was no",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,other clothing anywhere--and followed the voiceless sentry down through,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a labyrinth of elevators, finally emerging into a long corridor. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"strode down it, hearing my own steps echo; a second rhythm joined them",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"imperceptibly, and Gamine stole out of the darkness, swathed in the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"luminous veiling, creeping noiselessly as a ghost behind me. Later I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"became conscious of Evarin's padding cat-steps behind Gamine, trailing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"us, single-file. And other figures came from darkened recesses to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stretch the silent parade; a slim girl in a winged cloak, flame color;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a dwarfed man who walked beneath the amethyst huddle of purple cap and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"furs. Memory fitted names to them, but I did not speak to them, or they",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"After a long time, the immense corridor began to tilt upward, climbing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,toward a glimmer of light at the end. Without realizing it I had swung,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"into an arrogant, loping stride; now I brushed away the slave-soldier",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,who headed the column and took the lead myself. Behind me the others,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,fell into place as if I had bidden them; the flame-clothed girl in the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"winged cloak, the cat-footed Evarin, the dwarf bent in his jester's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cap, Gamine in the blue shroud. Without warning, we came out into a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"vast court; an enclosed space, yet wide as the outdoors, a yard, a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"plaza, a place of imposing grandeur. A place of memory.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The red sun above us glowed like a lurid coal. There were tall pillars,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"on three sides of the courtyard, and at the far end, a vaulted archway",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,led into a treelined drive that stretched away for miles into the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"twilight. Between two pillars, Karamy waited; slim, shimmering golden",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from head to foot. A hungry impatience sparked in her cat's eyes.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""You're late.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I'm ready,"" I said. What I was ready for, I was not sure.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Karamy waved an impatient signal to the Narabedlans who were coming up.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric is with us again,"" she said in her curious lazy voice, ""Your",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"allegiance to Adric--children of the Rainbow!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I stood at her side, mute, waiting; a guard of silent men behind us.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Lord Idris;"" Karamy summoned. The hunchback came to bow jerkily before",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"us. ""Welcome home--Lord!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The girl in flame-color darted to where we stood and her dipping curtsy,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was like the waver of a moth toward a flame. ""Adric--"" she murmured.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The wings of her cloak lifted and fluttered across her shoulders as if,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"they would fly of themselves. She was a shy thing, and her dark hair",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"waved softly as if it too were winged. I touched her fingers lightly,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"but under the smolder of Karamy's gaze I let her go. She watched me,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shyly, with averted face.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin's face was slyly malicious, but his voice was pure silk. ""It",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"is--pleasure to follow you again, my brother,"" he almost purred, and I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,scowled at the mockery at his face and refused his offered hand. Only,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine said nothing, coming forward on gliding feet to bow briefly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and retire; but the silver-sweet, sexless voice of the spell-singer",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"murmured in a singing, almost wordless, croon.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Save your spells, Gamine,"" said Karamy savagely, and Evarin jerked",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"round at the shrouded form, but Gamine heeded neither of them, and the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sweet contralto chanting went on.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"From somewhere the silent men brought horses. Horses--here, in this",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,nightmare world? I had never been on a horse in my life. I found myself,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"vaulting, with a nice co-ordination of movement, into the saddle. The",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"courtyard, for all the bustle of department, seemed to hold the silence",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of a grave. Karamy kept me close to her. When we were all mounted, she",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"threw the amber rod upward, and the last rays of the red sun caught",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,its rays and sent a pure shaft of light down the darkened alleyway,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lined with trees. At the sight of that gleam, a curiously familiar",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"emotion stole through me. I threw up one arm over my head, mimicking",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy's gesture. ""Ride!"" I shouted.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,And the flying steeds kept pace with mine.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The driveway under the arch of trees led for miles under the thick,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"boughs. Through the easy drumming of hooves, I could still hear the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sweet distant sound of Gamine's singing, which floated on the wind,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"keeping pace with the rise and fall of the rolling road, in a quick",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,cadence. The wind whipped Karamy's golden hair like a halo about,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,her head. I glanced over my shoulder to where the rainbow towers,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stood, now black, silhouetted against the greater darkness of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mountains. Overhead in the pink sky, the crescent of the tiny moon was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"brightening, and lower in the sky I saw another, wider disc, nearly at",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"full. Cold air was stinging my cheeks and nipping my bones with frost,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and I felt the sparks struck from hooves beating on the frozen ground.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"And for a moment, it was entirely Mike Kenscott--sick, bewildered and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"panicky--who glanced about him with horror, feeling the swirling cold",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and a colder chill from the golden sorceress at my side. It was Mike,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Kenscott's will that jerked at the reins of the big gelding to end this,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,with weird people I knew were not human--all right; I was a coward. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"steadied myself in the saddle, trying with every scrap of my will to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"calm myself. If this was a nightmare, well, I'd had some beauties--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But it wasn't. I knew that. The frost hurting my face, the sound of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shod steel on stones, the vivid colors around me, told me I was wide",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,awake. Dreams are not techni-colored. And through all this I was riding,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hell-for-leather, my knees gripped on the saddle, guiding the horse",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,with the grip of my thighs--and I'd never been on a horse's back in my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,life. Rode--and rode--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"We had ridden about seven miles, and stopped twice to breathe the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"horses, but we were still beneath the great archway of trees. The",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sky's pink sunset light had faded; the land was flooded with a blue,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fluorescent starlight, a light I'd never seen before. I strained my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,eyes upward through the black foliage. I suppose I had some confused,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,idea of guessing _when_ I was by the stars. But the view to the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"North was hidden by mountains, and I don't know one constellation",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"from another, with that single exception. A glance at Karamy, in this",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fright, un-nerved me; I touched the reins, dropped back till I rode",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"between Gamine and the girl in flame-color. ""Adric,"" the spell-singer",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"saluted coolly, and the girl in the winged cloak threw back her hood;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I saw dark eyes watching me from a pure, sweet young face. Before the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,luminous innocence of those eyes I wanted to cry out in protest. I was,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"not Adric, warlock of Narabedla. I was just a poor guy named Mike, I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was just--me. I rode beside Gamine for minutes, trying to think what I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,would say.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine's musical voice was not raised, yet it carried perfectly to my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ears. ""You seem wholly yourself again.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I didn't answer. What was there to say? Still, there seemed to be",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sympathy in the sharply-edged tones. ""You will remember--perhaps too",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"much--at the Dreamer's Keep.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Gamine,"" I asked, ""Who is _Narayan_?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I saw the blue robes quiver a little; across from Gamine, I saw a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,curious flickering look pass across the face of the girl in the orange,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,winged cloak. But Gamine's answer was perfectly even and disinterested.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""The name is not familiar to me. Have you heard it, Cynara?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The girl did not answer, only moved her dark head a little.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I should know,"" I mused. But the name _Cynara_ had touched",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,another of those live wires within my mind. Narayan. Cynara. Cynara and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan! If I could only remember! Suddenly I turned. ""Gamine--who are",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you?"" Gamine sat quiet, eerily motionless on the tall horse. The robed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,figure seemed to blend into the starlit shadows around us. I had the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sudden feeling of having re-lived this moment before, then the veiled",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shoulders twitched impatiently.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Is this an inquisition?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Rebuked, and stung by the arrogant voice, I touched my heel to my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,horse's flank and rode forward to rejoin Karamy. Gamine! The hell with,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"For several minutes the road had been climbing, and now we topped the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,summit of a little rise and abruptly the trees came to an end. By tacit,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,consent we all drew our horses to a walk. We stood atop the lip of a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"broad bowl of land, perhaps thirty miles across, filled to the brim",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"with thick dark forest. Far out in this valley lay a cleared space, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in the center of that space lay a great tower; but not a slender and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,fairylike spire like the Towers of Rainbow City. This was a massive,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,donjon thrusting heavy shoulders upward into the moon-washed sky.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The Keep of the Dreamers.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Something in me murmured, ""This is the forest where the Dreamer",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"walks!""--or had the murmured voice come from Gamine, motionless",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"behind me? Karamy rode eagerly, her face drawn tautly together, her",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,slim tanned hands clenched on the reins. All this while I was Mike,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Kenscott--but a Mike who watched himself without knowing what he would,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"do next, like those puzzling nightmares where a man is both actor and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,audience to some mummery being played. I watched myself say and do,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"things as if I were two men at once. In effect, I suppose I was....",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy turned in her saddle, facing me.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric,"" she murmured, ""Lead me where the Dreamer walks!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I knew, with a sudden surety, that because of some bond between the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"freed Dreamer and myself, I could do this. But again, something outside",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"myself told me what to say. ""That bond is broken, Karamy. Did you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"not break it yourself? How can I guide you then?"" And for my reward",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I saw unsureness leap in her cat's eyes. That shot had told. Karamy,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_had_ been guessing, then!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The answer had shaken her. But this woman was a past mistress at,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"subtlety. She murmured, ""It can be forged again. That I swear.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Ah, but I knew how far to trust even Karamy's oaths!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,We had dipped down into the bowl of forest and we were riding through,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"thick woods, along a road that struggled windingly, with many curves",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and sharp corners. Adric knew this country; his knowledge made Mike,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Kenscott shiver. He had hunted here, and for no fourlegged game. As if",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy read my thoughts I hear her low laughter. ""So. My wrist aches",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"for the feel of a falcon. We'll hunt here again--soon, you and I!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I was partly bewildered by her words, but they gave me a shivering",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"excitement, an insidious thrill.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Behind me, I heard Gamine's chanting take on a new note. The words were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"still indistinguishable, but the very tune screamed warning. A pulse",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,began to twitch jerkily in my neck.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Without any warning, the road twisted. Karamy and I spurred our horses",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and rounded the curve in one swift, racing burst of speed--and were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,fairly in the trap before we knew it.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"It was the agonized whinny of my horse, and the jolt of my body",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"righting itself automatically from the plunging animal beneath me,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that made me realize we had ridden straight on a chevaux-de-frise. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"yelled, cursing, shouting to Karamy to get back, get back, but her own",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,momentum carried her on; I saw her light body fly out of the saddle and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"disappear. The others, rounding the curve in a wild dash, were fairly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"on the barrier already, and the place was a bedlam, a scramble, with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,riderless horses milling in a melee of curses and the screaming of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"women and the threshing of feet. I was out of my saddle in an instant,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,thrusting Gamine's mount back from the stabbing points fixed invisibly,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"against the dark barrier in the road, shouting to Evarin and Idris.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin leaped to my side, catching at Karamy's wild horse, while I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,tore madly at the barrier where the woman had been thrown. Idris,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"bore down on me, mounted. ""Go round!"" he shouted. I plunged through",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the underbrush at the side of the road, with hasty feet twice snaked",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"by long creepers. Past the barrier, the road lay open and deserted,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and Karamy lay in a shimmer of crumpled silk, motionless. ""Gamine,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin--"" I bellowed, ""No one's here! Quick, Karamy is hurt--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The head and shoulders of Idris' horse thrust through the thick,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"brushwood. ""Is she dead?"" the dwarf muttered. I bent, thrusting my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hand to her breasts. ""Her heart's beating. Only stunned. Get down,"" I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ordered. Idris scrambled, monkey-fashion, from the saddle. I lifted the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"woman in my arms, but she did not move or open her eyes. Idris touched",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,my arm.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Put her on the saddle,"" he suggested, and together we laid her across",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the pommel. Suddenly, the dwarf cried out.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""What?"" I asked sharply.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I hear--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I never knew what Idris heard. His head vanished, as if snatched away",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"by a giant's hand; a rough grip collared me, choking fingers clawed at",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"my throat, a thousand rockets went off in my head and I lay sprawling",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in the brushwood, eating dust, with an elephant sitting on my chest and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,threatening hands gouging my throat. My last coherent thought before,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the breath went out of me, was--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,Narayan,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,But I wasn't. When I came to--it could only have been a few seconds,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that I was unconscious--it was to hear Evarin snarling curses and Idris,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"barking incoherently with rage. I heard Karamy screaming my name, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"started to answer, but the steely fingers were still at my throat",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and with that weight on top of me, I hadn't a chance. The fall, or",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"something, had knocked Adric clean out of me. I was fuzzy-brained, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sane. I was an innocent bystander again.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I could see Evarin and Idris in the road, casting wary glances at",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the brushwood all around them. I could just make out the face of the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,man who was holding me pinned to the earth with his body. He had the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"general build of a hippopotamus and a face to match. I squirmed, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the threatening face came closer and I subsided. The man could have,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,broken me in two like a match.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Around me in the thicket were dozens of crouching forms, fantastic",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,snipers with weapons at their shoulders. Weapons that could have been,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"crossbows or disintegrators, or both. ""Enter Buck Rogers,"" I thought",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wearily. I was beginning to feel faint again, and old welter-weight",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"on my stomach didn't help any. Abruptly he moved, delicate fingers",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,knotting a gag in my gasping mouth; then the intolerable weight on,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,my chest was suddenly gone and I sucked in air with relief. The fat,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"man eased himself cautiously up, and I felt a steel point caress my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,lowest rib. The threat didn't need words. I could see the Narabedlans,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"gathered, a tight little knot in the road. The snipers around me were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"still holding their weapons, but the fat man commanded in a low voice",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Don't fire! They're sure to have guards riding behind them--"" the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"voice died to a rasping mutter, and I lay motionless, trying to dredge",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,up some of Adric's memories that might help; but the only thing I got,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was a fleeting memory of my own football days and a flying tackle by a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Penn State halfback that had knocked me ten feet. Adric was gone; clean,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,gone.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The Narabedlans were talking in low tones, Gamine the rallying-point",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"round which they clustered. Evarin had his sword out, but even he did",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"not step toward the mantling thicket. Cynara was holding Evarin's arm,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"protesting wildly. ""No, no, no, no! They'll kill Adric--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Suddenly, between two breaths, the road was alive with mounted men. Who",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"they were, I never knew; I was quickly dragged to my feet and jerked",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"away. Behind me I heard shouting, and steel, and saw thin flashes of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,colored flame. Spots of black danced before my eyes as I stumbled along,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"between two captors. I felt my sword dragged from my scabbard. Oh well,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I thought wryly, now that Adric's run out on the party I don't know how",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to use it anyway.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Under the impetus of a knife I found myself clambering awkwardly into,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a saddle, felt the horse running beneath me. There wasn't a chance of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"getting away, and the frying pan couldn't be much worse than the fire,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,anyway.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Behind us the noises of battle died away. The horse I rode raced,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sure-footed, into the darkness. I hung on with both hands to keep",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from falling; only Adric's habitual reflexes kept me from tumbling,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,ignominiously to the ground. I don't think I had any more coherent,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,thoughts until the jolting rhythm broke and we came out of the forest,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,into full moonlight and a glare of open fires.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I raised my head and looked around me. We were in a grove, tree-ringed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"like a Druid temple, lit by watch-fires and the waver of torches. Tents",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sprouted in the clearing, giving it an untidy, gypsy appearance; at the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"back was a white frame house with a flat roof and wide doors, but no",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,windows.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Men and women were coming out of the tents everywhere. The talk was,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a Pentecost of tongues, but I heard one name, repeated over and over",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,again.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Narayan! Narayan!"" the shouts clamored.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"A slim young man, blond, dressed in rough brown, came from one of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the larger tents and walked deliberately toward me. The crowd drew,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,yards he made a signal to one of the men to untie my gag and let me,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"down. I stood, clinging to the saddle, exhausted; the young man came",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"forward until he could almost have touched me, and studied my face",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"dispassionately. At last he raised his head, turning to the fat man, my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,captor.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""This isn't Adric,"" he said. ""This man is a stranger.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I should have been relieved; I don't know why I wasn't. Instead, my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,first reaction was bewilderment and angry annoyance. How could he tell,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that? I was as furiously embarrassed as if I'd been accused of wearing,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stolen clothing. My beefy captor was as angry as I was. ""What do you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mean, this isn't Adric?"" he demanded belligerently, ""We took him right",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"out of their accursed cavalcade! If it isn't Adric, who is it?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I wish I knew,"" Narayan muttered under his breath. His eyes, still",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fixed on my face, were level, disconcerting. He was tall and straightly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"built, with pale blond hair cut square around his shoulders like a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"squire from a Provencal ballad, and grey eyes that looked grave,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"but friendly. I liked his looks, but he had a trace of the uncanny",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stillness I'd noticed in old Rhys, in Gamine. For a moment I decided to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,tell my whole fantastic story to this man with the grave eyes. He would,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"surely believe it. But to my surprise, he spoke and called me Adric;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"definitely, as if he had forgotten his doubts.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric,"" he said, ""Do you still remember me? Or did Karamy take that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"too?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I sighed. I didn't dare tell the truth, and I felt too chilled and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"exhausted and disoriented to lie convincingly. Yet lie I must, and do",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,it well.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The fat man scowled and fronted Narayan. ""Karamy--Zandru's eyelashes!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he growled. ""Look you, did Brennan come back this afternoon? He knows",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"his way around Rainbow City. Ask Adric what happened to Brennan!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The clamoring broke out around us again, but Narayan never took his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"eyes from my face as he answered gently, ""There is always danger, Raif.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Blame no man unjustly. Brennan knew he faced all the dangers of Rainbow,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Traitor!"" Raif snarled at me and spat.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I loosed the saddle-horn and stepped dizzily forward. ""You might try",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"asking me,"" I said with a weary anger.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Are you Adric of the Crimson Tower?"" fat Raif snapped.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I don't know--"" I said tiredly. ""I don't know, I don't know!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan's eyes met mine in skeptical puzzlement. Abruptly he put out,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"one hand and took my wrist in a firm grip. ""We can't talk here, whoever",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you are,"" he said, ""Come along.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,He led me through the thinning crowd into the frame house at the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"grove's edge; Raif and one other man trailed after us, the rest",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"clustering hive-fashion around the door. Inside, in a great timbered",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"room, a fire burned and glowing globes chased away darkness. I went",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,gratefully toward the fire; I was stiff with riding and I felt chilled,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and stupid and empty with the cold. From a wood settle near the fire,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a woman rose. She was slight and dark and around her shoulders the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,luminescent shimmer of her winged cloak flowed like another flame.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Cynara.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric--"" she said half-aloud, holding out her hands. I took them,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"partly because she seemed to expect it, partly because the girl seemed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the only thing real in a world gone haywire. She flung her arms,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,suddenly around my neck and held herself to me with a shy deliberation.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric, Adric, Adric--"" she begged, ""I slipped away in the dark--I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"suppose Gamine knows--but they'll never find me here, no, never--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan's hand pulled the girl sternly away from me; she shrank before,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the annoyance in his eyes. ""Please--Narayan, no--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The blond man looked at her without speaking for long moments. At last,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he said gravely, ""Sister, you must go back to Narabedla. I would not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"make you go if there was another way; but you must, for a time."" He",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"beckoned to one of the men. ""Kerrel--"" he commanded, ""Take Cynara back",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to Rainbow City, but don't get caught. Cynara; tell them you were lost",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in the woods, or that you were caught and escaped.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The childish mouth trembled, and she turned to me appealingly, but I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,gave a little shrug. What was I supposed to do? Narayan gave Cynara a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"gentle push. ""Go with Kerrel, little sister,"" he ordered in a quiet",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"voice; Kerrel took her arm and they hurried out of the room, the winged",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,cloak she wore fluttering on her shoulders. Narayan motioned to Raif to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"follow them through the door. ""I'll talk with him alone.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Raif's thick lips set stubbornly. He looked as if he'd be nasty in a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fight. ""If he's Adric, and if he's under Karamy's devilments, then--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I have faced Adric, and Karamy too,"" said Narayan with a friendly grin",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"at the man. ""Get out, Raif; you're not my bodyguard, or even my nurse!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The fat man accepted dismissal reluctantly, and Narayan came to my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"side. There was real friendliness in his grin. ""Well,"" he said, ""Now we",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"will talk. You cannot kill me, any more than I could kill you, so we",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"may as well be truthful with each other. Why did you leave us, Adric?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"What has Karamy done to you this time?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The room reeled around me. I put out a hand to steady myself--when the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"dizziness cleared, Narayan's arm was around my shoulders and he was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,holding me up with a strength surprising in his slight frame. He let,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me settle down on the seat Cynara had left. ""You have been roughly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"handled,"" he said in apology, ""Just sit still a minute. My men--"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"made a deprecating little gesture, ""have had orders. And if I know",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy's ways, you've been heavily drugged for a long time."" His eyes",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"studied me intently. ""Better come and have a drink. And--when did you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"eat last? You look half starved. That's the way of the _sharig_--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I rubbed my forehead. ""I can't remember,"" I told him honestly.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I thought so. Come along."" Narayan went into the next room, assuming",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that I would follow and that I knew my way around. After the insanely,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"furnished rooms in Rainbow City, I was a little surprised when the next",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"room proved to be a strictly functional and ordinary kitchen, equipped",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,with the usual items. Out of a relatively un-extraordinary icebox he,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,assembled something that looked rather like the food I was accustomed,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to from the 20th century, and poured some kind of liquid into an",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,oddly shaped glass. He motioned me into a chair and set the things on,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the table. ""Here, eat this. I know the drugs they give you; you'll",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"have more sense when you've eaten. We've plenty of time to talk, all",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"night if we choose."" He saw me glance side-wise at the glass, laughed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sketchily, and from the same bottle poured himself a drink and sat down",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"opposite me, sipping it slowly. ""Go ahead. I won't poison you till I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"find out what Karamy's up to.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I laughed apologetically and started eating, with a mental shrug. It",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"had been at least forty-eight hours since I had last tasted food, and I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"did justice to the plateful before me. Narayan sipped his drink--which,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"when I tasted mine, appeared to be excellent cognac--and watched me;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and when I finally pushed the empty plate aside, he put back his glass",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and said ""Now. Who are you, and what happened?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I felt better and stronger; more like myself than I'd felt since Rhys,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"had catapulted me into this world. But now that I was on the carpet, I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,felt I must talk fast and convincingly before those searching grey eyes.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Karamy had me shut in the Tower,"" I told him, ""I was freed today, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,we were on our way to the Dreamers Keep. Then your men came along.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I didn't know if I was being rescued or captured. I still don't."" I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,stared with purposeful blankness at Narayan; he stared back and I could,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"feel him debating what to do and say. Obviously, an Adric sane and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,glib and possibly untruthful was a different thing than an Adric too,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,bewildered and shaken to tell anything but the truth. Finally Narayan,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said, ""I'm not sure what I ought to do or say, Adric. The bond between",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"us isn't as strong as it was. You know that.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I nodded, perturbed. Adric's thoughts seemed to be surging back,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"insidiously, as if Narayan held the key to unlock them. What crazy",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,drama was going to be unfolded in my mind now?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan said, low; ""Karamy did it, I think.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Yes."" My own voice was as quiet as his own. ""Karamy sent me on the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Time Ellipse. She knew I'd come back changed--or mad--or not at all. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"think--I think she wanted me to betray you again.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric!"" Narayan reached out quickly and grabbed my arm, hard, above",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the elbow, till I cried out with the pain of that steely grip and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"twisted away, rubbing numbed flesh. ""Adric--"" Narayan repeated,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"unsteadily, ""Why do you say--betray me again? Betray me? Adric--it was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"your hand that freed me! Zandru! Adric--"" he begged, ""_How much_",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"have you forgotten?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,The fire in the other room had burned down to an ember. Without a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"glance my way, Narayan mended the fire; sat down, his legs stretched",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"toward the little blaze, his shin in his hands; waiting. I could not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stand still. I walked, restless, around the room, speaking in little",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,jerks and half-sentences.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"sacrifice.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""No!"" Narayan was as motionless as Gamine's veils, but his voice was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"harsh, strident. ""No, Adric, never that! We cannot--kill each other,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you and I. I could order you killed, I suppose, but I--I would never do",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that unless there was no other way. Adric--is there any other way for,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me, for you?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"A bitterness spoke in my voice; neither side trusted Adric, both wanted",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,his allegiance. I tried to trim my words carefully between the two,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,personalities that were battling for mastery in me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""It was Karamy,"" I said, ""who took Adric from you, and sent him,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"half-mad, back to the Crimson Tower. Karamy's magic stripped him of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"power, and sent him, gone mad, back to stargazing in Narabedla. But it",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was _not_ Karamy's--"" the voice that was not quite mine shook,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"at bay, ""It wasn't Karamy who sent _me_ here, I'm not Adric. You",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were perfectly right. I'm no more Adric than--than you are. I'm in,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric's body, yes. He moves me like a puppet! I have his memories,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"his--some of his thoughts--but he--"" my voice cracked suddenly on a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"note of panic; I knew I sounded like a hysterical kid, but I couldn't",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stop my own crackup once it had broken loose. ""I'm not Adric, I'm not!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"of course, from the beginning. But I didn't think Adric, when it came",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to the test, would really do that to me. I had his promise. I suppose,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"for him, it was an easy way out. A perfect way of escape."" He sank down",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"on the bench again, dropping his head in his hands. After a little,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he looked up, and his voice sounded tired. ""This is difficult,"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said. ""My men think you are Adric. I'd never be able to convince them",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you aren't. Would you mind--pretending? You'll have to; otherwise--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he paused, and I saw disquiet in his face. He was not a man who would",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"enjoy threatening, but I could understand his situation. They didn't",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,know me from Adam; I was just an outsider who messed things up by,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"resembling Adric. Well, I was stuck. I hadn't liked the Narabedlans",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"enough to give a hang what Narayan meant to do to them. Narayan, by",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"comparison, looked pretty decent. And there was no other way to save my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"skin. Adric wasn't too popular, it seemed and in Adric's body I hadn't",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a chance. I laughed. ""I'll try,"" I told him. ""But what's this all",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"about?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan looked up again. ""That's right. You wouldn't know. You have",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"some of Adric's memory, I suppose, but not all. You remember who I am?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Not entirely--"" I told him. I remembered some things. Narayan had been",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"born, some thirty years ago, into a respectable country family who were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"appalled to discover they had given birth to a mutant Dreamer, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were only too glad to deliver him to the Narabedlans for the enforced,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,stasis. I told Narayan.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""You remember the old Dreamer who served your House?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I nodded. He had become old, mortal, weak--and had been eliminated. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"bowed my head, although I had no personal guilt.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Afterward, Narayan and I had been bound. ""I slept in the Dreamer's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Keep--"" Narayan sounded reflective, almost guilty, ""I was wakened,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and--given sacrifice. I learned to use my power and to give it up to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric."" A brooding horror was in the grey eyes; I realized that Narayan",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,dwelt in his own personal private hell with the memory of what he had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"done under the spell of Narabedla. ""Adric was--strong.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Yes, I thought; Adric had called on Narayan's new power without",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,counting cost. What wonder the memory maddened Narayan? The young,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Dreamer seemed to win his silent fight for self-control. ""Well,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you--Adric, I mean--freed me. I found my sister again; Cynara. I was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"like a child; I had to learn to live, to be alive again. I had been",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,trained to use my power only through the Sacrifice. I had to learn to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"use it without. It wasn't easy.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Why?"" I asked thoughtlessly. Narayan's eyes froze me. ""To use that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"power,"" he said in a tense, controlled voice, ""Took human life.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,Outside the door I could hear the noises of the camp; the light of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,their watch-fires crept in through the cracks. It was too dark to see,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan's face now, but I heard him moving restlessly about the room.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I have harnessed the power somewhat,"" he said, ""I can use it, myself,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a little. Not much. Adric helped me; so did my sister. She had been,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"taken for Sacrifice, but you--Adric--redeemed her. Then--we were able",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to throw an illusion around Cynara. She is not of Narabedla; but we,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"made it seem as if she had always been there, in Rainbow City. We could",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"do that because Evarin is weak, and because Karamy did not care. It was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I was hearing scraps of conversation from a vast abyss of time and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"space, when I had been drawn in electric coma through Karamy's Time",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Ellipse. _They will know, Narayan will know._ That had been old",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Rhys. And Adric; _What have I to do with Narayan?_ Adric had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,been--still was--playing a fancy double game with Narayan; I started,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to open my lips to tell the young Dreamer about it, but he was still",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"talking. ""Rhys will not act, not directly, against Rainbow City. But he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"did that much for us, and Gamine and Cynara are friends. We forgot--we",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,all forgot--that Adric's allegiance belonged to Narabedla first. Until,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he vanished."" I heard the brooding heaviness in Narayan's voice. These",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"men had been friends. Narayan went on, ""I sent Brennan today, to find",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"out. He didn't come back.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I lowered my head and miserably told him what had happened to Brennan.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan's face in a flicker of firelight looked drawn and haggard. ""He",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was a--brave man,"" Narayan said at last. ""But I don't blame you. After",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the interchange, I think, there was a time when you went on living",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric's life. Thinking his thoughts. But now, I think, he will grow",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"weaker in you. I _hope_. You--who are you, in your own world?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I shrugged. The words would have meant nothing to Narayan. ""My name's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Mi-ek,"" Narayan repeated, turning the strange word on his tongue.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""The men will call you Adric. I'd better, too. Later--"" he shrugged. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,didn't say anything; I was still convinced that I hadn't seen the last,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of Adric. But I didn't want to tell Narayan this. I liked the man.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Without warning, Narayan switched on lights. ""It's near dawn, and you",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,must be worn out. We've taught them to stay clear of the forests at,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"night, so we're safe enough here. They can't do much till they've been",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to the Dreamers Keep, in any case."" With a sudden boyish friendliness",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he put out his hand and I took it. ""I'm glad you're not Adric. He might",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"As if the lights had been a signal, fat Raif came without knocking into",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the room. Narayan crossed his hostile stare at me. ""He's all right,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Raif,"" the Dreamer said. The fat face broke into a sudden, elephantine",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"smile. ""I'd better apologize, Adric. I had orders.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Find him a place to sleep,"" Narayan suggested, and I followed Raif",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"up a flight of low stairs into an inner room. There was a bed there,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"clean, but tumbled as if it had had another occupant not long ago. Raif",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said, ""Kerrel's gone with Cynara. You can sleep here.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I kicked off my boots and crawled between the blankets, suddenly too",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"weary even to answer. I had been two days without sleep, and most of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,that time I had been under exhausting physical and mental strain. I saw,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Raif cautiously finger his weapons and sensed that whatever Narayan,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said, he was reserving judgment. He didn't take chances, this outside",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lieutenant of Narayan's. Sleepily I said, ""You can put that up, my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I didn't even finish the sentence to myself. Instead I went to sleep.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I had slept for hours. I came abruptly out of confused dreams to hear a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shrill voice and to feel small hands pulling me upright. Cynara! ""Wake",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"up, Adric--"" she wailed, ""Karamy and Evarin are riding today--hunting",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_you_!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I sat up, dizzy-brained, far from alert. ""Cynara! How--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Oh, never mind that--"" her voice was impatient, ""What can we",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_do_?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I didn't know. I was still stupid with sleep, but I put a reassuring",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"arm around her shoulders. ""Don't be afraid,"" I told her, then,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"releasing her, bent and began to pull on my boots. I heard the swift",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"pound of steps on the stairs, and Narayan shoved open the door,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,dragging a brown tunic over his head as he came. He stopped short at,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the door, staring at his sister. ""Cynara, what are you doing here?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"She repeated her news, and he sighed. He looked as if he hadn't slept",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"at all. ""Well, never mind,"" he told her, ""The game was almost over,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,anyhow. Sooner or later they would have broken through the Illusion;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Rhys is too old now for that. You were lucky to get away. We'll have to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"storm the Keep to-night--unless they have too-good hunting."" He fumbled",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,with the laces of his shirt. A dead weariness was in his grey eyes;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"they looked flat, almost glazed. He met my questioning stare and smiled",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ruefully. ""The Dreamers stir,"" he told me, ""I am not yet free of--their",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"need. So I must be careful."" Cynara shuddered and threw her arms around",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"her brother's neck, clutching him with a fiercely sheltering clasp.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Narayan, no--oh, no--don't--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,But he was already deep in thought again. He freed her arms without,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"impatience. ""We'll meet that when the time comes, little sister. So",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy and Evarin ride hunting. Who else. Idris?"" At her nod, his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"brows contracted. ""All of them--but Gamine,"" he mused, and turned to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me. ""Could you conceivably get through to Rhys? I don't dare--not with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that--that stirring.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I understood, Narayan was still attuned to the terrible need of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sleeping Dreamers in the Keep. But I reminded him that only Gamine,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,could control old Rhys. He looked at me with a strange curious question,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in his eyes, but made no comment. My own mind was working strong. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was unsure how I had gotten here in the house of the freed Dreamer.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Just what had happened last night? I had thought Narayan would never,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"trust me again; but now, when I needed it most, I seemed to be in his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"complete confidence. Damn Karamy anyhow, meddling with my memory!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"And she had the audacity to fly Evarin's devil-birds after me--Adric,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,lord of the Crimson Tower! She should have a lesson she would not,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,forget--and so should the presumptuous Gamine--and so should this,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"walking zombie who was staring at me stupidly, as if I were his equal!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I said with a slow savagery, ""I think I can manage Gamine!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan was watching me anxiously. Gods of the Rainbow, what",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"preposterous things had I said and done last night? I said, ""We'll take",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"them at the Dreamer's Keep,"" and saw his face clear.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_But what you do not know, Narayan_, I added to myself with a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"secret satisfaction, _is that you will join them there!_",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"It never occurred to them to question, to wonder if Adric today were",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the Adric of last night. We went downstairs and snatched a quick,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,breakfast; Cynara tore off her winged flame-color cloak and stuffed it,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,wrathfully into the fireplace. Her coarse grey dress beneath it made,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"her shy prettiness more striking than ever; Cynara was not Karamy, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,she was a pretty thing; and Narayan could hardly fail to trust me when,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Cynara perched on the arm of my chair and ran her dainty fingers over,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the bruises on my face. ""Your roughs nearly killed him!"" she pouted at",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,her brother.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Oh, I'm not hurt,"" I smiled at her, making my voice gentle for her",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,ear alone. But I scowled darkly into my plate; pushed the food away,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and strode out into the camp. Narayan shouted quickly, jumping up,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sending his chair crashing to the floor, and he ran after me so that we",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"went down the steps together. ""Wait,"" he commanded in my ear, softly,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Don't forget, to them you're still a traitor!"" He took my arm, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"we walked through every row of tents together, Narayan's expression",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,almost belligerent. I saw the faces of the men as they came from their,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"improvised shelter, saw suspicion gradually give way to tolerance and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"then casual acceptance. Finally Narayan called to Raif. ""Stick to him,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"will you, Raif? He's all right, but the men don't know it yet.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I glanced at Narayan. ""Raif,"" I said tentatively, ""Can you find me",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,twelve men who know the way to Rainbow City and aren't afraid to come,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"close to it?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I can,"" Raif said, and went to do it. I had to hide a smile. Before",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,long I would win back the place my foolishness had lost. The idiot,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"whose body I had shared briefly had almost put it beyond recovery, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in a way he had helped, too. His weakness had won Narayan's confidence.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Well, one thing I knew, that futile idiot should not share the coming",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,triumph. Nor should Narayan.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan--fumbling in my pocket, I touched something smooth and hard.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin's mirror. Narayan, looking over my shoulder as I dragged it out,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"asked curiously, ""What's that?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I pulled it out with a secret smile. ""One of Evarin's toys. Look at it,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"if you like.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan took it in his hand for a moment, without, however, untwisting",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the silk. ""Go ahead,"" I urged, ""Unwrap it.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I might have sounded too eager. Abruptly Narayan handed it back. ""Here.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I had to conceal my disappointment. With a feigned indifference I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"thrust it back into the pocket. It did not matter. One way or another,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan would lose. For Evarin and Karamy rode a-hunting today--and I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,Narayan clung to a lower branch. My ears picked up the ring of distant,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hooves on frozen ground, and I smiled; I knew every nuance of this",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hunt, and Evarin might find his deadly birds not so obedient to his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,call today. Not a scrap of me remembered another world where a dazed,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and bewildered man had flown at a living bird with his pocketknife.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Coldly I found myself considering possibilities. A snare there must,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,be; but who: Narayan himself? No; he was my only protection until I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"got clear of this riffraff. Besides, if he ever unsheathed his power,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"unguarded like this, he could drain me as a spider sucks a trapped",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fly. No; it would have to be Raif. I had a grudge against the fat man,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"anyway. I pulled at his sleeve. ""Wait here for me,"" I said cunningly,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and made as if to leave the platform. Raif walked smiling into the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"trap. ""Here, Adric! Narayan gave orders you weren't to run into any",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"danger!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Good, good! I didn't even have to order the man to his death; he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"volunteered. ""Well,"" I protested, ""We want a scout out, to carry word",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"when they come."" _As if we wouldn't know!_",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I'll go,"" Raif said laconically, and leaned past me, touching",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan's shoulder. He explained in a whisper--we were all whispering,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"although there was no reason for it--and Narayan nodded. ""Good idea.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Don't show yourself.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I held back laughter. _As if that would matter!_,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The man swung down into the road. I heard his footsteps ring on the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"rock; heard them diminish, die in distance. Then--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"A clamoring, bestial cry ripped the air; a cry that seemed to ring and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"echo up out of hell, a cry no human throat could compass--but I knew",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"who had screamed. That settled the fat man. Narayan jerked around, his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"blond face whiter. ""_Raif!_"" The word was a prayer.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"We half-scrambled, half-leaped into the road. Side by side, we ran down",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the road together.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The screaming of a bird warned me. I looked up--dodged quickly--over,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"my head a huge scarlet falcon, wide-winged, wheeled and darted in at",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me. Narayan's yell cut the air and I ducked, flinging a fold of cloak",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"over my head. I ripped a knife from my belt; slashed upward, ducking my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"head, keeping one arm before my eyes. The bird wavered away, hung in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the air, watching me with live green eyes that shifted with my every",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"movement. The falcon's trappings were green, bright against the scarlet",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,wings.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I knew who had flown this bird.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The falcon wheeled, banking like a plane, and rushed in again. No",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,egg had hatched these birds! I knew who had shaped these slapping,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,pinions! Over one corner of my cloak I saw Narayan pull his pistol-like,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"electrorod, and screamed warning. ""Drop it--quick!"" The birds could",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"turn gunfire as easily as could Evarin himself, and if the falcon drew",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"one drop of my blood, then I was lost forever, slave to whoever had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flown the bird. I thrust upward with the knife, dodging between the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"bird's wings. Men leaped toward us, knives out and ready. The bird",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"screamed wildly, flew upward a little ways, and hung watching us with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,those curiously intelligent eyes. Another falcon and another winged,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"across the road, and a thin, uncanny screeing echoed in the icy air.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I heard the jingle of little bells. Three birds, golden-trapped and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"green-trapped and harnessed in royal purple, swung above us; three",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,pairs of unwinking jewel-eyes hung motionless in a row. Beyond them,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the darkening red sun made a line of blackening trees and silhouetted,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"three figures, a horse, motionless against the background of red sky.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin--Idris--and Karamy, intent on the falcon-play, three traitors",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,baiting the one who had escaped their hands.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The falcons poised--swept inward in massed attack. They darted between,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,my knife and Narayan's. Behind me a bestial scream rang out and I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knew one of the falcons, at least, had drawn blood--that one of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"men behind us was not--ours! Turning and stumbling, the stricken man",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ran blindly through the clearing, down the road--halfway to those",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"silhouetted figures he reeled, tripping across the body of a man who",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lay beneath his feet. Narayan gave a gasping, retching sound, and I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"whirled in time to see him jerk out his electrorod, spasmodically, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,fire shot after wild shot at the stumbling figure that had been our,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"man. ""Fire--"" he panted to me, ""Don't let him--he wouldn't want to get",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to--them--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I struck the weapon down. ""Idiot!"" I said savagely, ""Some hunting they",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_must_ have!"" Narayan began protesting, and I wrenched the rod",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from his hand. The man was far beyond firing range now. At Narayan's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,convulsed face I nearly swore aloud. This weak fool would ruin,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"everything! I said hastily, ""Don't waste your fire! We can take care of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_them_ later--"" I waved a quick hand at the three on the ridge.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""There is no help for those caught by Evarin's birds.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan breathed hard, bracing himself in the road. I beckoned the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"others close. ""Don't fire on the birds,"" I cautioned, tensely; ""It",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,only energizes them; they drain the energy from your fire! Use knives;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cut their wings--_look out!_"" The falcons, like chain-lightning,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,traced thin orbits down in a slapping confusion of wings and darting,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"beaks. I backed away from the purple-harnessed birds, flicking up my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"cloak, beating at the flapping wings. Our men, standing in a closed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"circle back to back, fought them off with knives and with the ends of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"their cloaks thrown up, swatting them off; and three times I heard",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the inhuman scream, three times I heard the lurching footsteps as a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,man--not human any more--broke from us and ran blindly to the distant,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ridge. I heard Narayan shouting, whirled swiftly to face him--he ran",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to me, beating back the green-trapped bird that darted in and out on",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"swift agile wings. The screeing of the falcons, the flapping of cloaks,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the panting of men hard-pressed, gave the whole scene a nightmare",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"unrealness in which the only real thing was Narayan, fighting at my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"side. His gasp of inhuman effort made me whirl, by instinct, flinging",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"up my cloak to protect my back, my knife thrust out to cover his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"throat. He raked a long gash across the down-turned head of the falcon,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was rewarded with an unbirdlike scream of agony and the spasmodic,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,open-and-shut of the razor talons. They raked out--clawing. They,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"furrowed a slash in the Dreamer's arm. The razor beak darted in, ready",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to cut. I threw myself forward, unprotected, off balance, ready to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,strike.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,At the last minute talons and beak turned aside--drew back--darted,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"swiftly, straight at me. And my knife was turned aside, guarding",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But Narayan jerked aside. His knife fell in the road, and his arm",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shot out--grabbed the bird behind the head, twisting convulsively so",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the stabbing needle of a beak could not reach him. The darting head,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lunged, pecking at the cloak that wrapped his forearm; thrown forward,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I stumbled against Narayan, carried by my own momentum, and we fell in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a tangle of cloaks and knives and thrashing legs and wings, asprawl in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the road. The deadly talons raked my face and his, but Narayan hung on",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"grimly, holding the deadly beak away. I thrust with the knife again",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and again; thin yellow blood spurted in great gushes, splattering us",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,both with burning venom; I snatched the wounded bird from the Dreamer's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,weakening hands twisted till I heard the lithe neck snap in my fingers.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The bird slumped, whatever had given it life--gone!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,And high on the ridge the dwarfed figure of Idris threw up his,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,hands--fell--collapsed across the pommel of his saddle!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan's breath went out limply in a long sigh as we untangled our,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,twisted bodies. Our eyes met as we mopped away the blood. We grinned,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,spontaneously. I liked this man! Almost I wished I need not send him,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,back to tranced dream--what a waste!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"He said, quietly, ""There is a life between us now.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I twisted my face into a smile matching his. ""That's only one,"" I said.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""The rest--"" I turned, watching for a moment as the falcons tore at",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the ring of men. ""Come on,"" Narayan shouted, and we flung ourselves",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"into the breach. I flung down my knife, snatched a sword from someone",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and swung it in great arcs which seemed somehow right and natural to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me. The men scattered before the sword like scared chickens, and I went",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mad with hate, sweeping the sword in vicious semi-circles against the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lashing birds ... the sword cut empty air, and I realized startlingly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that both birds lay cut to ribbons at my feet, their blood staining the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"dead leaves. Narayan's eyes swam, through a red haze, into my field of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"vision. They were watching me, trouble and fright in their greyness. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,forced myself to sanity; dropped the sword atop the dead birds. I wiped,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,my forehead.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""That's that,"" I said banally.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"We took toll of our losses, silently. Narayan, gasping with pain,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"rubbed a spot of the yellow blood from his face. ""That stuff burns!"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,grimaced. I laughed tightly; he didn't have to tell me. We'd both have,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"badly festered burns to deal with tomorrow. But now, there was work--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Look!"" One of the men stared and pointed upward, his face tense with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"fright. Another great bird of prey hung on poised pinions above us,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sapphire eyes intent; but as we watched, it wheeled and swiftly winged",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"toward the Rainbow City. Not, however, before I had caught the azure",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shimmer of the bells and harness. A thin, sweet tinkling came from the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The Return of Adric,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Back in the windowless house, we snatched a hurried meal, cared for",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"our slashed cuts, and tried to plan further. The others had not been",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,idle while we fought the falcons. All day Narayan's vaunted army had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"been accumulating, I could hardly say assembling, in that great bowl of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,land between Narabedla and the Dreamer's Keep. There were perhaps four,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"thousand men, armed with clumsy powder weapons, with worn swords that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"looked as if they had been long buried, with pitchforks, scythes, even",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,with rude clubs viciously knobbed. I had been put to it to conceal my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,contempt for this ragtag and bobtail of an army. And Narayan proposed,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to storm Rainbow City--with this! I was flabbergasted at the confidence,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"these men had in their young leader. So much the better, I thought,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,take him from them and they'll scatter to their rat-holes and crofts,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"again! I felt my lips twisting in a bitter smile. They trusted Adric,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"too. When I had shown myself to them, their shouts had made the very",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"trees echo. Well--again the ironic smile came unbidden, that was just",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"as well, too. When Narayan was re-prisoned, I could use the power of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,their lost leader to tear down what he himself had built. The thought,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,was exquisitely funny.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""What are you laughing about,"" Narayan asked. We were lounging on the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"steps of the house, watching the men thronging around the camp. His",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"slumberous grey eyes held deep sparks of fire, and without waiting",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"for my answer he went on, ""Think of it! The curse of the Dreamer's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"magic lifted--what would it mean to this land, Adric? It means",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"life--hope--for millions of people!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"In a way, Narayan was right. I could remember when I had shared that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,dream; when it had seemed somehow more worthy than a dream of personal,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"power. Cynara came down the steps, bent and slipped her soft arms",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"around my shoulder, and I drew her down. A volcano of hate so great I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"must turn my face away burned up in me. This man was my equal--no, I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"admitted grudgingly, my superior--and I hated him for it. I hated him",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,because I knew that in his dream of power no one must suffer. I hated,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"him because, once, I had been weak enough to share his feelings.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I said abruptly, ""Your plans are good, Narayan. There's just one thing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,wrong with them; they won't work. Storming Rainbow City won't get you,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"anywhere. You could kill Karamy's slaves by the thousands, or the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"millions, or the billions. But you couldn't kill Karamy, and you'd",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,only leave her free to enslave others. You've got to strike at them,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"""What about Gamine?"" Cynara asked practically. Gamine was the least",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of my worries, but I did not tell Cynara that. I listened to their",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,comments and suggestions a little contemptuously. Didn't they know,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that when the Dreamers woke, the Narabedlans were vulnerable--to the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"Cynara scowled at the rip of talons across my face. ""You're hurt and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"of it!"" I almost laughed. Me--Adric of the Crimson Tower--being ordered",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"around by a little country girl! I snorted, but spoke pleasantly. ""I'll",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"live, I expect. Come and sit here with us."" I pulled her down at my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"side, but she leaned her head on her brother's knee, an unquietness",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in her face. She was a pretty thing, although the cause of all my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"troubles. When I redeemed her from Karamy's slaves, for a whim, I had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"not known she was Narayan's sister--Zandru's hells, but I had made a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,ghastly slip! I had told Narayan there was no help for those touched by,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the birds, when I myself had redeemed his own sister! Had he noticed?",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Would he attribute it to Karamy's meddling with my mind? I smothered,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"an exclamation, and Cynara and Narayan looked up anxiously. ""You",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_are_ hurt, Adric!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I shook my head. I fancied Narayan looking at me with suspicion, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I controlled myself. I reached out to draw Cynara to me, but she had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"drawn back, rising lithely to her feet, like a dove poised for flight;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"only her hands, small darting hands like candle-flames, remained in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mine to pull me lightly to my feet. I tried to hold her, but she",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"protested, ""There is so much to be done--"" and I raised the slim hands",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to my lips before I let her go. The gesture pleased her, I could see;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"so much that I watched with contempt as she tripped away. Silly, simple",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"Karamy's guards; we rode in the opposite direction, by a twisting side",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"road. Cynara rode beside me, her dark eyes glowing. There was dainty",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"witchery in Cynara, and a pretty trust that made me smile and promise",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"recklessly, ""We will win."" It pleased me to think that I could comfort",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Cynara for her brother's downfall. Once conditioned to Rainbow City,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,she would forget her silly fancies and be a fair and lovely comrade. If,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,It took us an hour of hard riding to reach the lip of the great cup of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"land, where we paused, looking down the dark, almost-straight avenue",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of trees that led to the walls of Rainbow City. I whistled tunelessly,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"between my teeth. ""Whatever we do, it will be wrong. We'd be taking",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"quite a chance to ride up to the main gate; at the same time, they'll",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"thumb. ""Chance. Two seeds, we go around. Three, we ride straight up",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I jounced the seeds in my palm. ""One for Evarin, and one for Idris, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"toward the towers we rode, under the westering red sun, and just before",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,nothing I could say without spoiling the illusion I had worked so hard,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to create. I took his hand for a minute. ""Thank you."" His voice was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"equally abrupt. ""Good luck, Adric."" Cynara glanced at me briefly and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,It was easy enough to find my way into the labyrinthine towers. I was,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,not Lord of the Crimson Tower without knowing its secrets. I climbed,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the stairs swiftly, ransacked the place. To no avail. When she took my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"memories, Karamy had also been careful to take everything which could",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"conceivably give me any power over any of the Dreamers, even old Rhys.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I went up more stairs till I stood at the very pinnacle of the tower,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in Adric's star-room into which I had been catapulted--was it less than,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"three days ago? I stood at the high window, vaguely thinking of an",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"older Adric, an Adric who had watched the stars here, and not alone. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"traced back through the years, diving down deep into the seas of sudden",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"memory, and brought up the knowledge of--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Mike Kenscott!"" said a voice behind me, and I whirled to look into the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,face of a man I had never seen before.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,He had the primitive look of a man out of some forgotten past. I had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,seen such men as I swam in the light of the Time Ellipse. He was tall,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and clean-shaven; he looked athletic; his eyes were a ridiculous color,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"dark brown. He had hair. He looked angry, if he could be said to have",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,an expression.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"But he spoke, clearly and with a deliberate calm. ""Well, Mike",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Kenscott,"" he said, in a language I had never heard, but found myself",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"suppose I should thank you. You've given me freedom, and Narayan's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"trust--the rest I can do for myself!"" He laughed. ""In fact, you're so",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,much _me_ that I'm not much of myself. But I _can_ force you,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"own Tower, and by Zandru's eyelashes, he'd pay for it! I flung myself",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Of course I understood, even while I fought, dizzy and reeling, to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"loose the deathgrip I had put on my own body. I was--back, I was Mike",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Kenscott again--Adric loosed his hands of his own will, and stepped",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"away, breathing hard. ""Thank you,"" he said in the raw voice that had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"been mine for so long, ""I myself could hardly have done better."" With",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a swift movement he snatched something from a little recess in the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,wall--pointed--and fired point-blank. A lance of grey mist stabbed out,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,at me--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"To my amazement, only a pleasant heat warmed me. I had enough",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,split-second reasoning reflex left to fall in a slumped huddle to the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"ground. I knew that was what he expected. Adric fumbled in his pockets,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"took out the little mirror I had taken from Evarin, still wrapped in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"its protective silk. I watched, breathless, between narrowed eyelids.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,If he would only open it--but instead he gave a shudder of disgust and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flung it straight at me. With a braced, agonizing effort I made myself",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"lie perfectly still, without flinching to avoid the blow. The mirror",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,struck my forehead. I felt blood break to the surface and trickle wetly,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,down my face. I heard Adric moving; heard receding steps and the risp,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of a closing door. He was gone.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I moved. To this day I am not sure how I escaped death from Adric's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,weapon; but I think it was because I was in my own body. After I had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"touched Adric the first time, I was immune to Earth electricity. In",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"this world, I think, I was immune to their force. I wiped the blood",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"from my temple. Good Lord, there was Narayan--waiting with Cynara--I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"forgot that I had plotted against Narayan, remembering only that I had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,liked the man. I couldn't let Adric get to them--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I grabbed the mirror, crammed it into a pocket. Against the nightmare",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"haste that drove me I ran to the closet, quickly, from the racks of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"weapons, chose a short ugly knife. I didn't need swordsman's training",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to use that. Thank God, I knew my way around, I could remember",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"everything I'd done when I was Adric--but wait! I could also ""remember""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,what he had done when _he_ was _me_! That meant Adric could,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I dashed out of the room, ran down the endless stairs three at a time.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"At the entrance to Gamine's blue tower, a dangerous whirring of wings",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"beat around me; I staggered, almost fell backward. One of the murderous",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"falcons--the one in blue--darted, hanging poised in the stair-well",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"above me. I backed against the wall, hoping the bird would not attack.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine had not flown falcon with the others.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The strong wings flapped in the closed space; I saw the dart of the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"vicious little beak. Blindly I struck upward with the knife, shielding",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"my eyes with the other hand, and was rewarded with a splatter of thin",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,burning blood and a scream of unbirdlike agony. I ducked beneath the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"thrashing wings, and ran on up the stairs; behind me the dying falcon",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"flapped, threshed and rolled down the stairs, a tangle of wings,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,landing far below with a flailing thump.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I was not quite sure what I meant to do. As I climbed, I thought",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"swiftly. Gamine was no friend to Adric, I knew that. Adric had known",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"much of Gamine and Rhys, and I drew on that knowledge, but even Adric",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,had not known much of the Spell-singer cloaked in that blurred halo of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,invisibility. Had he ever seen Gamine?,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,What was Adric doing now? I had served him well; won him Narayan's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"trust, then turned him loose again in his own body, to destroy, betray",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,them! I hated Adric as I hope I may never hate again.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"And yet, I could not hate him wholly. To know all is to forgive much,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and I had lived for three days and nights in Adric's body and brain;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knowing his strengths and his weaknesses, his dreams and torments, I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,could not condemn him utterly. A man may be forgiven much that he does,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"for a woman's bewitchments, and few men could be blamed for allowing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy to enslave them. Adric had done good, once, too; he had freed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the Dreamer, he had loved--but he had trapped me here, and for that, my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,hate would make him pay--thoroughly!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"A shadow flitted across my sight; the robed Gamine barred my way, an",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,air of cold amusement around the poise of the hood and the blurred,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"invisible head. The Spell-singer laughed, mocking. ""How like you this",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"body, Adric? You are beaten now, for sure! The stranger works with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I'm not Adric,"" I shouted. ""Adric's in his own body again! He's going",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"after Narayan--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""You expect me to believe that?"" Contempt stung me in Gamine's clear,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sexless voice.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Let me to Rhys,"" I begged. ""He'll know I'm telling the truth--damn",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"it, let me by!"" Infuriated by the mocking laughter, I thrust my arm to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"move Gamine forcibly from my path. Whatever Gamine was--man, woman,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,imp or boy--it was not human. Steel wires writhed between my hands.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I struggled impotently in that bone-breaking grip; then with a swift,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,impulse thrust my hand quickly at the blurred invisibility where,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine's face should have been.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine screamed--a thin cry of horror. Suddenly I knew where I had been,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"those two weeks I lay in the hospital,--when Adric lay, in my body,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"gone mad, in the hospital in my place. An instinct I had grown to trust",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,warned me to pull away sharply from Gamine's relaxed grip. I shouldered,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,by and ran like hell.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Halfway up the stairs I heard the Spell-singer's feet running behind,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"me, and I quickened my stride and sprinted for the heavy door that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,barred my way. I could feel Rhys' presence behind the door. I threw my,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"weight against the door, twisting the handle frantically.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The door was locked.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Behind me, I heard the padding tread of Gamine. Hopelessly, I put my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"back to the door, pulling my knife out again, and defied the creature.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Behind me the door suddenly opened and I was flung backward, sprawling,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"into the room within. ""Well, Mike,"" the old tired voice of Rhys said,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Gamine is a fool, but you are no better. Yes, I knew you were coming,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I knew Adric is going, I know where Narayan is and I know what they",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"plan to do. There is only one person who can stop all this, Mike",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Kenscott. You.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gaping stupidly, I picked myself up from the floor. The old Dreamer,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"his wrinkled face serene under the peaked hood, watched me placidly.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""What--how--"" I stammered.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Gamine is a prescient. And I am not a complete fool."" Rhys smiled",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,wearily. The dreamy look of the very old or the very young was on his,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face. ""I cannot help you; but I will make Gamine help.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The spell-singer came into the room, and I could almost see resentment",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"through that strange halo of nothingness. ""Gamine,"" Rhys said. ""It is",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"time. You, and Narayan, must go with him to the Dreamer's Keep.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""No--"" Gamine whispered in protest, ""Narayan--cannot go!",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,His--his--talisman was destroyed! Only outside the tower--he cannot go,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""There is still--mine. Give it to him."" At Gamine's cry of dismay,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Rhys' voice was suddenly a whip-lash. ""Give it to him, Gamine! I still",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,have power to--compel that! What does it matter what happens to me? I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"am old; it is Narayan's turn; your turn.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I'll--keep it for Narayan--"" Gamine faltered.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""No!"" Rhys spoke sharply. ""While you keep it--and I am bound to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"you--there is still the bondage. Give it to him!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine sobbed harshly. From the silken veils she drew forth a small,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,jewelled thing; wrapped in insulating silk like Evarin's mirror. She,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"untwisted the silk. It was a tiny sword; not a dagger, but a perfectly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"modelled sword, a Toy. Evarin's too; but different. I recalled that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin had called himself Toymaker. Gamine clung to it, the robed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shoulders bent.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Mike must take it,"" Rhys' voice was gentler. ""If you keep it, I am",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"still bound to you. If Adric had it, it would bind Narayan again. If",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Mike keeps it--_near_ Narayan--Narayan is free. Free to go where,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"he will, even in the Dreamer's Keep. Give it to him, Gamine."" Rhys sat",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"down, wearily, as if the effort of speech had tired him past bearing.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I stood and listened with a rebellious patience; I was eager to be,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,gone. But my eyes were on the little jewelled Toy in Gamine's hands.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"It winked blue. It shimmered. It pulsed with a curious heartbeat,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hypnotic. Rhys watched, too, his tired face intent and almost eager.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Gamine; if Adric had seen you, had remembered--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I want him to remember!"" Gamine's low wail keened weirdly in the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,silent room. Rhys sighed.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I am Narabedlan,"" he said at last, ""I could not destroy my own people.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine is not bound--nor you, Mike Kenscott. I suppose I am a traitor;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,but when I was born Narabedla was a fair city--without so many crimes,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"on its head. Go and warn Narayan, Mike.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine hovered near me, intent, jealous, the shrouded eyes fixed on",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Rhys. The old man spoke on in a fading voice. ""My poor city--now,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine. Now. Give it to him and let me rest. Stand away from me, Mike;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"well away; I do not want the bondage again from you.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I did not understand and stood stupidly still. Gamine gave me an angry,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"push. ""Over there, you fool!"" I reeled, recovered my balance, stood",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"about six feet from the couch where Rhys half-sat, half-lay. The old",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,man laid one wrinkled hand on the toy sword Gamine held. He took his,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,hand away.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Now,"" he said quietly.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine thrust the sword into my hand, and I felt a sudden stinging",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"shock, like electric current, jolt my whole body. I saw Gamine's robed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,body shiver with the same jolt. The Toy in my hand was suddenly heavy;,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"heavy as if it were made of lead, and the tiny winking in the hilt was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,darkened. The peaked hood of Rhys drooped until it covered the face.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine caught my arm roughly and the steel of those narrow fingers bit,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,to the bone as they hauled me almost bodily from the room. I heard the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,echo of a sob in the Spell-singer's whispering croon.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,_Rhys--Farewell!_,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The next thing I knew we were racing side by side down flight after,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,flight of stairs. Together we fled through the subterranean passages of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Rainbow City. Outside, in the pillared court, a man ran toward us. His",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,brown tunic was ripped and torn; his blond hair was rumpled. A smudge,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of blood reddened his forehead. I gasped, ""Narayan!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The man whirled--saw us--pulled his weapon from his belt. There was no,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,time for explanations. I threw myself at his knees in a flying tackle,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"no football coach would approve, but it did the trick. Narayan went",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"down under me, kicking. Gamine was not one to stand aside in a fight;",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the robed figure rocketed forward, flung itself on the prone Narayan,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,holding him motionless with that steely strength. I wrenched the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"electrorod from Narayan's relaxed fingers. ""Listen--"" I urged, ""I'm not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"one of Karamy's men--Gamine, let him up!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""He's got Cynara--"" the Dreamer muttered dizzily, ""Cynara--who in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Zandru's hells are you?"" He picked himself up, gazing at me with a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stunned, blank look. ""My name's Kenscott,"" I said briefly. Suddenly,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"feeling it was the best way to establish my good-faith, I pulled out",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the Toy Gamine had put in my hand. ""I've seen Rhys. He sent--this.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan stared at the thing in my hand, a double grief in his young",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face. ""Rhys--"" he muttered, ""I felt he was--gone!"" With bent head, he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,reached out to take the small thing from me.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,In his hand it came alive. The small jewelled Toy seemed suddenly,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"brilliant, flaring, dazzling with a wild burst of faceted light, blue,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"golden, crimson, flame-color. Gamine's low sweet voice breathed, ""In",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the Dreamer's hands!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""In my hands,"" Narayan murmured in a choked, almost a tranced ecstasy.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I broke in on their raptures rudely. ""Here, Narayan! Is it Adric who's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"got Cynara?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,He gulped; swallowed hard; thrust the Toy into a pocket and came back,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to himself, but that light was still in his eyes. He spoke with a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hard restraint. ""Yes. Adric surprised me--knocked me out. When I came",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to, they were gone."" He blinked once or twice; rubbed his eyes; then,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"resolutely fumbled for the little Toy and extended it to me. ""Here.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Keep this till we get to the Dreamer's Keep.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I took it without comment. Gamine slipped away; came back, leading",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"horses. ""I couldn't find a single guard,"" the cold voice murmured, ""I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wonder where they are?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric knows,"" said Narayan, tight-lipped.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,We mounted.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The wind was rising. Above us the moons swung slowly in an indigo,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sky. Sparks flew from our hooves against the frosty stones. We were,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"racing against time, and a nightmare panic had me while I gripped the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,saddle of my racing horse. It took all my concentration to stick on,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the animal's back, but I was acquiring balance and a feel for riding.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The ill wind was blowing some good, I thought inanely. Narayan's blond",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"hair was frosty pale in the moonlight, and the eerie Gamine was a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"nightmare ghost, a phantom from nowhere. Far away we heard the spatter",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of gunfire, the screams of dying men, the ring of swords and spears.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Thinly Gamine chanted in the night. Narayan's face looked haunted.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""There are the guards--attacking--"" he jerked out over the hoof-noises.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The scream of falcons rang swiftly above Gamine's chant. The,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"too-familiar beat of wings slapped around my head, and I flung up my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,arm to knock away one serpentine neck. My terrified horse plunged and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I rocked in the saddle nearly falling. Another bird swooped down on,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan--another--then there were swarms of them, gold and purple and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"green, crimson, blue, flame-color. The air was thick with their wings.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine screamed; I saw Narayan beat the air with his cloak. The veiled,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Spell-singer, crouched in the saddle, was lashing at them with the whip",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"from her saddle. The lash kept the falcons at bay, but the razor talons",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"caught at the blue shroudings. Narayan, whip in one hand, sword in the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"other, beat round him in great arcs, and I heard one bird's death-cry",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sending ringing echoes to the sky. I flung round me with my knife--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"They were coming in scores--hundreds, whirling and screeing. These",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"were not the soul-falcons, belled and elaborately endowed with the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,intelligence and cunning of their launcher. These were--machines.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Alive, yes, but not a life we knew. Only the nightmare freak of a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,science gone mad could produce--or control--these hateful things that,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"were filling the clean air, groping for us with needle beaks and talons",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and wild wings. Only Evarin--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I fumbled blindly for the mirror, clumsily stripping the silks. A",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"needle-talon raked at my wrist, and by sheerest instinct I struck",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"upward, turning the face of the mirror toward the bird.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The bird reeled in mid-air--flapped--fell. A tingling shock rattled,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,through my arm. I dropped the mirror--leaped to catch it. The thing was,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,a perfect conductor. It--drained energy. I knew now why Evarin had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,been so anxious to have me--or Adric--look into its depths. It could,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,have touched the energy waves of my brain through my eyes. The birds,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,were brainless; all energy. I grabbed the mirror and held it upright; I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"caught a half-glimpse, from the tail of my eye, of the weird lightnings",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"coiled inside it, but even that glimpse coiled my stomach in nervous",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knots. Shielding my face, I held it upward. The birds flew toward it",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,like a moth to the candle. Shock after shock flowed along my arm. Three,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"more of the horrible falcons fell limp, lifeless--drained.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,A strange exhilaration began to buoy me up. The force from the birds,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"was not electricity but a kindred force, which my nerves drank",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,greedily. I thrust the mirror out; was rewarded again by the surge of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"power, and again the birds, this time by dozens, flapped and fell.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Then, as if whatever had loosed the army of falcons had realized their",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"uselessness, the whole remaining force of the birds wheeled and fled,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,winging swiftly over the land to the distant donjon that rose high and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,far into the black midnight.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,The flow of strength had renewed me; I felt that I could face whatever,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,came. I thrust Evarin's mirror into my pocket; flung a word to Narayan,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and we were riding again, Gamine racing behind us. The blue shroudings",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,had been torn to ribbons by the snappings of falcon-claws; I could see,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the pallid gleam of naked flesh through the torn veils. The noise of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,battle behind us grew more distinct; I could make out the explosions,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and the distant flashes of colored flame. I shuddered; even now that,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,frightful army of falcons might be winging to join Adric and Evarin.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The rebels could kill some of them, but for every falcon dead there",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,would be twenty more slaves for Narabedla! What could Narayan's men,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,with their scythes and pitchforks and rude rusty guns do against the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,incredible science of a Toymaker? Narayan's strained face was ghastly,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,in the moonlight; I needed no telepathy to read his thoughts. Slaughter,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"for his men--what for his sister? Our horses seemed to lag, to drag",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"through a mire of motionless, yet they were at the full gallop of their",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,endurance. The sound of fighting grew closer. Everything in me cried,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"out that I was an utter fool, riding full tilt into a battle in which I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"had no stake. Yet something else told me, coldly and with a grim truth,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"that all I possessed was what I might win today, for this was the only",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,world I would ever know; that I would never see my own world again.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Never! And Adric should rot in a hell of his own choosing for that!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The sounds of fighting seemed very close. Narayan pulled up his horse,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,so quickly that it nearly sent Gamine plunging into his back. He,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said in a low, concentrated voice, ""Adric isn't at the battle! This",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"way--quick!"" He whirled the horse and dashed down a side road at right",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"angles to the way we had been riding. If we had raced before, now our",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"horses seemed to fly. The battle raged behind us; I heard dim screams,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the neighing of wounded horses, the muffled sound of earth flying",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"upward, exploded in fire. But it had a dreamy unreal quality, like",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,noises through a nightmare. We had left the forest and were riding,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,across a dark and hummocky plain. Moss padded our hoof-noises; now,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and then some small furry thing skittered across the track we were,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,following and twice my horse shied at swooping birds and my heart,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,stopped until I saw they were not the falcons of Evarin.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Stark and black against a treeless horizon I could see the Dreamer's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Keep, between the small crescents of the two lesser moons. The largest",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"one rode a golden orbit over my head. I rode hunched in the saddle, my",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,eyes on the vast cairn only a few miles away.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Suddenly a vast arch of lightning spanned the sky above the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Dreamer's Keep. Blue lightning. I heard Narayan groan like a man,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in his death-agony. Twisting in my saddle, I saw brooding horror",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"on his face--mingled with pain--and a terrified satisfaction. ""The",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sacrifice--I still--feel it,"" he breathed in labored gasps, ""I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"still--take from it--Mike! Mike--"" His voice held unbearable torture,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and the veins in the fair face stood out, black and congested with",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"effort. ""If I start to work for--them--promise--promise to shoot me--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Oh God--"" I gasped.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Mike, promise! Gamine!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine spurred the horse to his side; I heard the low voice, sweet,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,almost crooning. Again the vast arch of blueness spanned the sky.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan dug spurs savagely into the side of his horse and raced ahead,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of us. On the plain, limned starkly against the sky, a horseman",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"appeared. He rode low in the saddle, his horse carrying a double",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"burden, but racing fleetly--to the Keep of the Dreamers. I cursed--I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knew that lean crouched figure, knew it as well as my own! Adric rode",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"to the sacrifice--and before him, limp across his saddle, he bore",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Cynara!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The rest of that nightmare ride is a blank in my mind. The next thing,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I remember clearly is reining up beneath the lee of the gaunt pile of,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,rocks-on-rocks that was the Dreamer's Keep. There was no sign of Adric,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"or Cynara, no sign of any living person, nothing but the incandescent",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,blue lightning that rayed out now every four seconds or so; Narayan's,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"face was a white death-mask, and Gamine's breathing came in short",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sobbing pants. I alone was free from the effect. My body throbbed and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,tingled with the weird energy set free in the night. We flung ourselves,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from our horses. Gamine tugged futilely at the torn veilings to conceal,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"her face, and for the first time the blurred invisibility wavered and I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"caught a glimpse of one blue eye, blue as the sky lightnings that rose",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and flared and died.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The lee of the tower dwarfed us with its massive bulk. Gamine clutched,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"my arm, the cruel fingers digging bruisingly into my flesh. ""Listen!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I strained my ears. All I could hear was a low, not unpleasant humming,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,like the singing drone of great bees or high-tension wires; but the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sound struck both aliens with horror. Narayan opened his lips--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I dug frantically in my other pocket; brought out the Toy Rhys had,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,given me. At sight of it Narayan's haggard face relaxed a little. He,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"caught it from me with quick hands. ""Free of Adric--"" he breathed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"with that swift erasure of tension I had seen before. He drew a long,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,moaning sigh. He closed his eyes for a moment.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Somewhere above us a scream rang out; a cry bestial in its mad appeal.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"It broke the static immobility that held us, and Narayan, sliding the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Toy inside his shirt, turned and began to run around the Tower, Gamine",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and I panting at his heels.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,We came around the corner beneath an arching outcrop of stone-work.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"No one needed to give orders; as one, we scrambled up on the ledge,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,crowding close together.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I gripped my hand on the knife in my belt. It had a comforting feel. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,needed that.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,A framed archway let us look down into the inside of the Keep. Below,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"us a voice cried out despairingly--unbelievingly. ""Adric--"" we heard",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Cynara cry out, ""Adric, no--oh, no--"" Under our combined weight the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,glass shattered; we hurled inward. We found ourselves standing on a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"great shelf, about ten feet above the interior floor of the Keep,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"looking down at a scene framed in stark horror. Golden Karamy, dwarfed",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Idris, Evarin--stood in a close circle about a ring of coffins which",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,gleamed crystal--glowed with scintillant radiance. In the hand of each,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of them was a tiny, jewelled, faceted Toy, and in the coffins--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine screamed.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""The Dreamers--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Not till then did we see Adric and what he was doing. In the center,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of the ring of coffins a dais rose upright, horribly altar-like, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a line of the mindless slaves, nude, vacant-eyed, defiled before the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,altar. As each slave stepped forward there was a shuddering moan from,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the others, the tiny swords rose and fell and in a brilliant flame of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"blue light, the slave--was not! And Adric--Cynara struggling between",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"his hands--was thrusting her forward, into the space between the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"coffins, toward the nexus of the blue light--toward the Sacrifice-stone",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,of the Dreamers!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The sight put us beyond caution. We threw ourselves from the ledge--and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"went down into a writhing, sprawling mass of living flesh. A barked",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"command from Idris, and the slaves swarmed on us, drowning us in",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,smothering bodies. I kicked and sprawled and thrashed and scratched and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"bit my way to the top of the heap and somehow for a second, I rolled",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"free. That instant was enough. I was on my feet, the knife in my hand.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Dragging bodies clung at my heels; I kicked out savagely, felt my boot",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"strike naked flesh, felt and heard the pulpy sound of a skull crushing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"under the impact of my heel. The sound rocked my stomach, but I was",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,not in a position to be fastidious. My eyes were swimming in trickling,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,blood. Gamine clawed and thrust free and together we elbowed out of the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,press.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Evarin sprang at me. I thrust blindly with the knife in my hand, ripped",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"into his shoulder, missing the throat by inches. I caught the Toy from",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"his hand as it fell free. A moment of the clinging, tearing melee--then",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,we three--Gamine and Narayan and I were standing back to back in the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,centre of the ring of coffins. There was a long howl of pain and terror,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,from Evarin and the four Narabedlans flung themselves backward in a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,panic terror. For within the coffins the Dreamers were waking!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,But Adric was no coward. He threw himself quickly forward--caught,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"at Cynara again, and with all the force in his lean arms he flung",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,her--straight toward the nexus of blue light! Narayan and Gamine stood,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"frozen, bound by the Toys in their hands against the light, but I broke",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,free--I passed straight across the cone of blue lightning--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,_Unharmed!_ The blasting energy tingled pleasantly in my body as,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I caught Cynara in mid-air and reeled away from the force that would,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,have meant annihilation for her. Narayan broke away from the paralysis,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,momentarily and caught Cynara's staggering body from my arms. Then I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"felt the impact as Adric's tall, heavy body crashed against me, felt",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,the shock as my fist smashed against his jaw and heard him grunt as we,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,locked into a clinch that carried us nearer--and nearer to that center,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of blue energy. A moment we swayed there, at the very edge of the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,lightning--then Evarin's tensed cat-body hit in the centre of my back--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Again the heat thrust needles through me. Adric was flung clear, but",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"there was an arch of blue that spanned the vault, a wild scream like",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"the death-cry of a panther, and the Toymaker was--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,_Gone!_,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Within the coffins the blue lights wakened, as if the last flare of",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"energy had freed them. Quickly Idris and Karamy ran forward, quickly",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric leaped to join them, thrusting the Talisman Toys against the very",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,lids of the coffins--but too late. The Toys in the hands of Narayan,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and Gamine spat glaring blue fire, and step by step the Narabedlans",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"retreated; farther, farther, farther--",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The coffins were suddenly empty. As if by magic, three old men and a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,woman of surpassing beauty materialized about Narayan and Gamine. In,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,their faces I could distinguish a curious likeness to Narayan and to,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"old Rhys--and Narayan, within the circle of the Dreamers, reached out",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and flung the tattered veils from Gamine. A triumphant chant rushed,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,sweetly from the lips of the Spell-singer as the veils came away and,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in the center of the mutants stood Gamine the Dreamer, dwarfing them",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,all by a pure majesty; the majesty of a Dreamer who had never slept!,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"A woman she was, slender and fair and very beautiful and as like to",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan as a twin sister, and I thought of Isis and the young Osiris",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,as the blue eyes blazed out and the lovely body arched upward in tall,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,freedom from the shrouding veils. Blue lightning swirled and faded,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,and the Dreamer's tower was bathed in trembling irridescent rainbows.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy and Idris retreated step by step, slinking back into the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,shadows. Only Adric stood his ground.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,The Rainbows died. The air was void and empty of energy. The Dreamers,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stood looking on the crouching Karamy with her hidden face, on the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"bent, gnarled dwarf, on Cynara, kneeling white and radiant, on Adric,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"who stood with his lips parted, staring at Gamine like a man released",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"from a spell. It was Gamine who spoke, her eyes resting on Karamy.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""She has done much evil.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"The others clamored, but Gamine shook her head, long pale hair lifting",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"electrically around her face. ""No,"" she disclaimed softly, ""Why should",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,they die? They are only an old dwarf--a silly fool who could not make,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"up his own mind--"" her eyes dwelt disquietingly on Adric. ""And Karamy.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Adric, slowly, drew himself upright. His slackly-parted lips set",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"firmly and he looked at Narayan with a dispassionate, stubborn shrug.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Kill me, if you like.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""No, Gamine."" Narayan stepped toward the man in crimson, ""Adric,"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said in a strange, half-choked excitement, ""I want to see what you saw",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,before--to see what sent you away--to see the thing that drove you mad.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,"saw then!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine came forward slowly to where Karamy knelt. ""Stand up!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Slowly Karamy rose to her feet. There was no hope in her eyes; no mercy,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in Gamine's. The two pairs of eyes, cat-yellow and blue, fought for a",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,moment; it was Karamy's that fell. The Dreamer woman smiled faintly.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""My brothers and my sisters,"" she said at last, ""Karamy is beautiful,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"is she not?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,I suppose no woman on earth has ever been or ever will be as beautiful,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"as Karamy the Golden. She stood proudly, turning to Adric, and I saw",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"longing and love break forth in the man's eyes. He gazed and gazed, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Karamy laughed and held out her arms, and Adric, bemused, went toward",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"

50566,eyes. I was sick and retching with horror before the metamorphosis was,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"half complete, and turned away my eyes; Cynara was sobbing softly into",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"her skirt; but Adric, frozen, could not look away.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Gamine's laugh--low and sweet and doubly deadly for its,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"sweetness--reached my ears. ""Shall I lend you my veils--sister?"" She",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"murmured, mocking, and again the horrible laugh. ""NO? Go _forth_!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Her voice was a lashing whip, and with a broken wail, the thing that",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,had been Karamy threw up an arm across the staring sockets and fled,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,away into the night. And we never saw it again.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,So that was the end of Karamy the Golden--the end--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,A little later I found that Adric and I were staring stupidly at one,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"another, puzzled, but without animosity. Cynara came and slipped an arm",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"round Adric, and I turned away, embarrassed, for the man was sobbing",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,like a child. I was amazed and sick with the enormity of all that I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,had seen and done. I stood and shivered and shook with deadly chill. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,suppose it was reaction.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Steady!"" Narayan's steely hand on my shoulder kept me once again from",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"making an ass of myself. ""You've done us a big favor,"" he said after",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"a few minutes. ""I wish I had some adequate way of thanking you--not",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,for myself--for millions of people. Perhaps one day we'll find a way,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"of sending you back to your own world, but--"" his shoulders moved",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"negatively, ""I can't say--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Adric's lean non-human face peered over Narayan's shoulder. He looked,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"subdued, and spoke with a curious humility. He sounded sane. ""There",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"_will_ be a way, some day. It will take time to find it, now,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"but--there will be.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Spontaneously we grinned at each other. I could not hate this man. I,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knew him too well. I knew, suddenly, that we would be friends. Which,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"indeed, is what happened.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Narayan looked from one to the other of us, troubled; then Gamine's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,intent face was at his elbow.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""I'll see to these men,"" she said quietly. ""Narayan, they need you, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"it's your responsibility. They have to be told why they were wakened,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"and how; there are slaves to be freed, armies--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan glanced guiltily over his shoulder at the other Dreamers who,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"stood huddled together in a bewildered little knot. ""That's so,"" he",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"acknowledged gravely, and went to his people. I watched him, feeling",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,as if my one friend here had deserted me; but it had to be that way.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Narayan was not our kind. He was the sort of man who could remodel a,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,world; but the look he sent us over his shoulder told Adric and I that,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"we should, if we liked, have a share in that work.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Now Mike Kenscott,"" said Gamine, ""I want to talk to you.""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"We left Adric and Cynara in that place, and I cast a wistful glance",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"back at them. Cynara was lovely, and very human, and I suppose I had",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,hoped that in some way she would compensate for my enforced stay in,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,this world. But there was Adric--,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"Gamine and I stood on the steps of the Dreamer's Keep, and her voice,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"soft and wistful, mourned in the grey dawn. ""No one ever knew I had the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Dreamer powers--except old Rhys. Rhys and I were bound together--he,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"knew, and kept me close to him, hid me and helped me. One day Adric",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,found out. It--changed Adric. He--we freed Narayan together. Then,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Karamy made me what I was--what you saw. It hurt Adric--hurt something,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"in him. I could have cured him, in time, but Karamy had him bewitched.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"She stripped him of power, of memory. I do not know, but perhaps some",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"day, Adric may remember that I was--I was--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Gamine! Gamine!"" Adric's voice cried from within, and the next",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"moment he rushed forth--caught the Dreamer woman in his arms, and his",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"mouth met hers and she stood swaying in his arms, laughing and crying",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"together. Cynara, following slowly, smiled with gentle satisfaction. I",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"said, stunned, ""What--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Over Adric's shoulder Gamine's blue eyes met mine in liquid,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"satisfaction and she finished her interrupted sentence. ""I was Adric's",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"wife,"" she said, gently.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,Cynara's voice was tenderly humorous as we left them together in the,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"glory of the rising sun. ""Poor Gamine,"" she said, ""and poor Adric, too.",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I was sorry for them both. But I wish these men would make up their,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"minds!""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I had an idea.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"""Adric's made up his mind,"" I said, turning my head a little toward the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"couple who stood, clasped, as if they could never let go. ""I suppose--""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"I came a little closer to Cynara, who stood looking up at me with wide,",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"innocent eyes and lips ingenuously parted, ""I suppose that gives me the",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"right to make up my mind. Doesn't it?""",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,"She smiled. ""Does it?"" But her bright eyes had given me my answer, and",Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
50566,I never had to make up my mind again.,Falcons of Narabedla,"Bradley, Marion Zimmer"
