"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4198,4377,NA,When it was dark and he sat before the coffeeroom fire awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast his mind was busily digging digging digging in the live red coals

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,378,446,NA,Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear and frowned heavily
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,448,459,NA,Why Why

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,936,1045,NA,This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not a word of it had reached the young ladys ears
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1047,1263,NA,But by this time she trembled under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deep anxiety and above all such dread and terror that Mr Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1605,1635,NA,They went up slowly and softly
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1637,1691,NA,The staircase was short and they were soon at the top
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1693,1954,NA,There as it had an abrupt turn in it they came all at once in sight of three men whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged through some chinks or holes in the wall
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1956,2110,NA,On hearing footsteps close at hand these three turned and rose and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wineshop
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2112,2185,NA,I forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained Monsieur Defarge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2187,2231,NA,Leave us good boys we have business here

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2278,2607,NA,There appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper of the wineshop going straight to this one when they were left alone Mr Lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette I show him in the way you have seen to a chosen few Is that well  I  think it is well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2609,2625,NA,Who are the few

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2800,2843,NA,Stay there if you please a little moment
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2845,2948,NA,With an admonitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and looked in through the crevice in the wall
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2950,3077,NA,Soon raising his head again he struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to make a noise there
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3079,3229,NA,With the same intention he drew the key across it three or four times before he put it clumsily into the lock and turned it as heavily as he could
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3231,3323,NA,The door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into the room and said something
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3325,3357,NA,A faint voice answered something
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3359,3431,NA,Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3433,3493,NA,He looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3495,3600,NA,Mr Lorry got his arm securely round the daughters waist and held her for he felt that she was sinking
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3602,3701,NA,Aaabusiness business he urged with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3703,3768,NA,Come in come in I am afraid of it she answered shuddering
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3770,3776,NA,Of it

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3801,3814,NA,Of my father
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3816,4012,NA,Rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4014,4081,NA,He sat her down just within the door and held her clinging to him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4083,4198,NA,Defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside took out the key again and held it in his hand
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4200,4300,NA,All this he did methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4302,4382,NA,Finally he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4384,4417,NA,He stopped there and faced round
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4419,4735,NA,The garret built to be a depository for firewood and the like was dim and dark for the window of dormer shape was in truth a door in the roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieces like any other door of French construction
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4737,4843,NA,To exclude the cold one half of this door was fast closed and the other was opened but a very little way
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4845,5089,NA,Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means that it was difficult on first coming in to see anything and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5091,5352,NA,Yet work of that kind was being done in the garret for with his back towards the door and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wineshop stood looking at him a whitehaired man sat on a low bench stooping forward and very busy making shoes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5354,5364,NA,CHAPTER VI
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5366,5479,NA,The Shoemaker Good day said Monsieur Defarge looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5481,5637,NA,It was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded to the salutation as if it were at a distance Good day You are still hard at work I see
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5639,5743,NA,After a long silence the head was lifted for another moment and the voice replied YesI am working
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5745,5842,NA,This time a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5844,5896,NA,The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5898,6007,NA,It was not the faintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6009,6089,NA,Its deplorable peculiarity was that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6091,6157,NA,It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6159,6316,NA,So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6318,6387,NA,So sunken and suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6389,6598,NA,So expressive it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6600,6853,NA,Some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes had looked up again not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood was not yet empty
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6855,6963,NA,I want said Defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker to let in a little more light here
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6965,6992,NA,You can bear a little more
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6994,7180,NA,The shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air of listening at the floor on one side of him then similarly at the floor on the other side of him then upward at the speaker
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7182,7236,NA,What did you say You can bear a little more light
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7238,7272,NA,I must bear it if you let it in
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7274,7333,NA,Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7335,7423,NA,The opened halfdoor was opened a little further and secured at that angle for the time
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7425,7550,NA,A broad ray of light fell into the garret and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausing in his labour
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7552,7636,NA,His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7638,7735,NA,He had a white beard raggedly cut but not very long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7737,7968,NA,The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really otherwise but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7970,8062,NA,His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body to be withered and worn
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8064,8317,NA,He and his old canvas frock and his loose stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in a long seclusion from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchmentyellow that it would have been hard to say which was which
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8319,8415,NA,He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones of it seemed transparent
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8417,8479,NA,So he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze pausing in his work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8481,8729,NA,He never looked at the figure before him without first looking down on this side of himself then on that as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound he never spoke without first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8731,8837,NA,Are you going to finish that pair of shoes today asked Defarge motioning to Mr Lorry to come forward
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8839,8937,NA,What did you say Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today I cant say that I mean to
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8939,8951,NA,I suppose so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8953,8966,NA,I dont know
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8968,9037,NA,But the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9039,9104,NA,Mr Lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9106,9193,NA,When he had stood for a minute or two by the side of Defarge the shoemaker looked up
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9195,9461,NA,He showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it his lips and his nails were of the same pale leadcolour and then the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9463,9514,NA,The look and the action had occupied but an instant
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9516,9568,NA,You have a visitor you see said Monsieur Defarge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9570,9609,NA,What did you say Here is a visitor
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9611,9687,NA,The shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9689,9709,NA,Come said Defarge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9711,9773,NA,Here is monsieur who knows a wellmade shoe when he sees one
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9775,9812,NA,Show him that shoe you are working at
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9814,9832,NA,Take it monsieur
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9834,9863,NA,Mr Lorry took it in his hand
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9865,9926,NA,Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9928,10001,NA,There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied I forg

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,31,126,NA,What did you say I said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieurs information
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,128,148,NA,It is a ladys shoe
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,150,183,NA,It is a young ladys walkingshoe
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,185,210,NA,It is in the present mode
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,212,232,NA,I never saw the mode
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,234,266,NA,I have had a pattern in my hand
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,268,330,NA,He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,332,368,NA,And the makers name said Defarge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,370,645,NA,Now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and so on in regular changes without a moments intermission
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,647,879,NA,The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a fastdying man
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,881,928,NA,Did you ask me for my name Assuredly I did
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,930,965,NA,One Hundred and Five North Tower
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,967,1017,NA,Is that all One Hundred and Five North Tower
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1019,1129,NA,With a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to work again until the silence was again broken
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1131,1209,NA,You are not a shoemaker by trade said Mr Lorry looking steadfastly at him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1211,1404,NA,His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him but as no help came from that quarter they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1406,1436,NA,I am not a shoemaker by trade
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1438,1472,NA,No I was not a shoemaker by trade

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1511,1623,NA,I asked leave to He lapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1625,1834,NA,His eyes came slowly back at last to the face from which they had wandered when they rested on it he started and resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake reverting to a subject of last night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1836,1955,NA,I asked leave to teach myself and I got it with much difficulty after a long while and I have made shoes ever since
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1957,2128,NA,As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him Mr Lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face Monsieur Manette do you remember nothing of me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2130,2206,NA,The shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2208,2308,NA,Monsieur Manette Mr Lorry laid his hand upon Defarges arm do you remember nothing of this man
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2310,2321,NA,Look at him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2323,2333,NA,Look at me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2335,2443,NA,Is there no old banker no old business no old servant no old time rising in your mind Monsieur Manette
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2445,2701,NA,As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at Mr Lorry and at Defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2703,2790,NA,They were overclouded again they were fainter they were gone but they had been there
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2792,3427,NA,And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him and where she now stood looking at him with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him but which were now extending towards him trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast and love it back to life and hopeso exactly was the expression repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light from him to her
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3429,3468,NA,Darkness had fallen on him in its place
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3470,3607,NA,He looked at the two less and less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3609,3682,NA,Finally with a deep long sigh he took the shoe up and resumed his work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3684,3719,NA,Have you recognised him monsieur
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3721,3747,NA,asked Defarge in a whisper
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3749,3767,NA,Yes for a moment
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3769,3893,NA,At first I thought it quite hopeless but I have unquestionably seen for a single moment the face that I once knew so well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3895,3899,NA,Hush
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3901,3925,NA,Let us draw further back
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3927,3932,NA,Hush
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3934,4015,NA,She had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench on which he sat
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4017,4158,NA,There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4160,4203,NA,Not a word was spoken not a sound was made
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4205,4268,NA,She stood like a spirit beside him and he bent over his work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4270,4378,NA,It happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand for his shoemakers knife
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4380,4448,NA,It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4450,4545,NA,He had taken it up and was stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4547,4579,NA,He raised them and saw her face
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4581,4662,NA,The two spectators started forward but she stayed them with a motion of her hand
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4664,4734,NA,She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife though they had
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4736,4862,NA,He stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began to form some words though no sound proceeded from them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4864,4962,NA,By degrees in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he was heard to say What is this
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4964,5132,NA,With the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to her lips and kissed them to him then clasped them on her breast as if she laid his ruined head there
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5134,5169,NA,You are not the gaolers daughter
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5171,5201,NA,She sighed No Who are you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5203,5280,NA,Not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the bench beside him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5282,5329,NA,He recoiled but she laid her hand upon his arm
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5331,5466,NA,A strange thrill struck him when she did so and visibly passed over his frame he laid the knife down softly as he sat staring at her
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5468,5575,NA,Her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedly pushed aside and fell down over her neck
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5577,5648,NA,Advancing his hand by little and little he took it up and looked at it

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8111,8490,NA,Conspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate Jerry stood aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer and gin and tea and coffee and what not that flowed at him and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8492,8643,NA,The object of all this staring and blaring was a young man of about fiveandtwenty wellgrown and welllooking with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,590,788,NA,My mind is a blank from some timeI cannot even say what timewhen I employed myself in my captivity in making shoes to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1045,1091,NA,A singular circumstance then arose in the case
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1093,1639,NA,The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down with some fellowplotter untracked in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago and got out of the mail in the night as a blind at a place where he did not remain but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more to a garrison and dockyard and there collected information a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required in the coffeeroom of an hotel in that garrisonanddockyard town waiting for another person
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1641,1952,NA,The prisoners counsel was crossexamining this witness with no result except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper screwed it up and tossed it to him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1954,2070,NA,Opening this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2072,2131,NA,You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2133,2159,NA,The witness was quite sure
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2161,2210,NA,Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2212,2271,NA,Not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2273,2415,NA,Look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointing to him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon the prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2417,2428,NA,How say you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2430,2460,NA,Are they very like each other
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2462,2692,NA,Allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other to surprise not only the witness but everybody present when they were thus brought into comparison
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2694,2836,NA,My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig and giving no very gracious consent the likeness became much more remarkable
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2838,2976,NA,My Lord inquired of Mr Stryver the prisoners counsel whether they were next to try Mr Carton name of my learned friend for treason
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2978,3263,NA,But Mr Stryver replied to my Lord no but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once might happen twice whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner whether he would be so confident having seen it and more
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3265,3386,NA,The upshot of which was to smash this witness like a crockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3388,3494,NA,Mr Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3496,3816,NA,He had now to attend while Mr Stryver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compact suit of clothes showing them how the patriot Barsad was a hired spy and traitor an unblushing trafficker in blood and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judaswhich he certainly did look rather like
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3818,4258,NA,How the virtuous servant Cly was his friend and partner and was worthy to be how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim because some family affairs in France he being of French extraction did require his making those passages across the Channelthough what those affairs were a consideration for others who were near and dear to him forbade him even for his life to disclose
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4260,4707,NA,How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed came to nothing involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown togetherwith the exception of that reference to George Washington which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4709,5099,NA,How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears and therefore Mr AttorneyGeneral had made the most of it how nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of which the State Trials of this country were full
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5101,5253,NA,But there my Lord interposed with as grave a face as if it had not been true saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5255,5566,NA,Mr Stryver then called his few witnesses and Mr Cruncher had next to attend while Mr AttorneyGeneral turned the whole suit of clothes Mr Stryver had fitted on the jury inside out showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them and the prisoner a hundred times worse
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5568,5747,NA,Lastly came my Lord himself turning the suit of clothes now inside out now outside in but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into graveclothes for the prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5749,5820,NA,And now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmed again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5822,5958,NA,Mr Carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5960,6599,NA,While his learned friend Mr Stryver massing his papers before him whispered with those who sat near and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury while all the spectators moved more or less and grouped themselves anew while even my Lord himself arose from his seat and slowly paced up and down his platform not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish this one man sat leaning back with his torn gown half off him his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6601,6977,NA,Something especially reckless in his demeanour not only gave him a disreputable look but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness when they were compared together had strengthened that many of the lookerson taking note of him now said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6979,7108,NA,Mr Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour and added Id hold half a guinea that  he  dont get no lawwork to do
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7110,7160,NA,Dont look like the sort of one to get any do he
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7162,7377,NA,Yet this Mr Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in for now when Miss Manettes head dropped upon her fathers breast he was the first to see it and to say audibly Officer
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7379,7402,NA,look to that young lady
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7404,7438,NA,Help the gentleman to take her out
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7440,7468,NA,Dont you see she will fall
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7470,7560,NA,There was much commiseration for her as she was removed and much sympathy with her father
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7562,7654,NA,It had evidently been a great distress to him to have the days of his imprisonment recalled
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7656,7824,NA,He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned and that pondering or brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavy cloud ever since
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7826,7923,NA,As he passed out the jury who had turned back and paused a moment spoke through their foreman
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7925,7967,NA,They were not agreed and wished to retire
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7969,8162,NA,My Lord perhaps with George Washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward and retired himself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8164,8243,NA,The trial had lasted all day and the lamps in the court were now being lighted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8245,8308,NA,It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8310,8420,NA,The spectators dropped off to get refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock and sat down
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8422,8591,NA,Mr Lorry who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out now reappeared and beckoned to Jerry who in the slackened interest could easily get near him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8593,8646,NA,Jerry if you wish to take something to eat you can
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8648,8668,NA,But keep in the way
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8670,8716,NA,You will be sure to hear when the jury come in
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8718,8800,NA,Dont be a moment behind them for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8802,8886,NA,You are the quickest messenger I know and will get to Temple Bar long before I can
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8888,9004,NA,Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9006,9072,NA,Mr Carton came up at the moment and touched Mr Lorry on the arm
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9074,9209,NA,How is the young lady She is greatly distressed but her father is comforting her and she feels the better for being out of court
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9211,9237,NA,Ill tell the prisoner so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9239,9340,NA,It wont do for a respectable bank gentleman like you to be seen speaking to him publicly you know
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9342,9479,NA,Mr Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind and Mr Carton made his way to the outside of the bar
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9481,9575,NA,The way out of court lay in that direction and Jerry followed him all eyes ears and spikes

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9790,9861,NA,As to me the greatest desire I have is to forget that I belong to it

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,837,888,NA,A slight frown and a laconic Yes were the answer
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,890,947,NA,Thats a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,949,965,NA,How does it feel
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,967,1068,NA,Is it worth being tried for ones life to be the object of such sympathy and compassion Mr Darnay
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1070,1102,NA,Again Darnay answered not a word
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1104,1170,NA,She was mightily pleased to have your message when I gave it her
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1172,1231,NA,Not that she showed she was pleased but I suppose she was
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1233,1381,NA,The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had of his own free will assisted him in the strait of the day
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1383,1443,NA,He turned the dialogue to that point and thanked him for it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1445,1515,NA,I neither want any thanks nor merit any was the careless rejoinder

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3095,3106,NA,Good night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3108,3248,NA,When he was left alone this strange being took up a candle went to a glass that hung against the wall and surveyed himself minutely in it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3250,3374,NA,Do you particularly like the man he muttered at his own image why should you particularly like a man who resembles you

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3483,3596,NA,A good reason for taking to a man that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3598,3734,NA,Change places with him and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was and commiserated by that agitated face as he was

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3777,3797,NA,You hate the fellow
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3799,4010,NA,He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation drank it all in a few minutes and fell asleep on his arms with his hair straggling over the table and a long windingsheet in the candle dripping down upon him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4012,4021,NA,CHAPTER V
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4023,4083,NA,The Jackal Those were drinking days and most men drank hard
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4085,4387,NA,So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman would seem in these days a ridiculous exaggeration
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4389,4694,NA,The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities neither was Mr Stryver already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice behind his compeers in this particular any more than in the drier parts of the legal race
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4696,4847,NA,A favourite at the Old Bailey and eke at the Sessions Mr Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4849,5233,NA,Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite specially to their longing arms and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Kings Bench the florid countenance of Mr Stryver might be daily seen bursting out of the bed of wigs like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank gardenfull of flaring companions
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5235,5512,NA,It had once been noted at the Bar that while Mr Stryver was a glib man and an unscrupulous and a ready and a bold he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocates accomplishments
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5514,5568,NA,But a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5570,5791,NA,The more business he got the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton he always had his points at his fingers ends in the morning
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5793,5868,NA,Sydney Carton idlest and most unpromising of men was Stryvers great ally
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5870,5967,NA,What the two drank together between Hilary Term and Michaelmas might have floated a kings ship
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5969,6325,NA,Stryver never had a case in hand anywhere but Carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring at the ceiling of the court they went the same Circuit and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings like a dissipated cat
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6327,6560,NA,At last it began to get about among such as were interested in the matter that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion he was an amazingly good jackal and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6562,6684,NA,Ten oclock sir said the man at the tavern whom he had charged to wake himten oclock sir  Whats  the matter
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6686,6723,NA,Ten oclock sir What do you mean
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6725,6757,NA,Ten oclock at night Yes sir
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6759,6791,NA,Your honour told me to call you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6793,6796,NA,Oh
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6798,6808,NA,I remember
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6810,6831,NA,Very well very well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6833,7012,NA,After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes he got up tossed his hat on and walked out
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7014,7173,NA,He turned into the Temple and having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of Kings Benchwalk and Paperbuildings turned into the Stryver chambers
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7175,7291,NA,The Stryver clerk who never assisted at these conferences had gone home and the Stryver principal opened the door
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7293,7383,NA,He had his slippers on and a loose bedgown and his throat was bare for his greater ease

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4606,4747,NA,When he got out of the house the air was cold and sad the dull sky overcast the river dark and dim the whole scene like a lifeless desert
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4749,4939,NA,And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast as if the desertsand had risen far away and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4941,5168,NA,Waste forces within him and a desert all around this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace and saw for a moment lying in the wilderness before him a mirage of honourable ambition selfdenial and perseverance

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5829,5939,NA,Hundreds of People The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet streetcorner not far from Sohosquare
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5941,6237,NA,On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason and carried it as to the public interest and memory far out to sea Mr Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived on his way to dine with the Doctor
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6239,6388,NA,After several relapses into businessabsorption Mr Lorry had become the Doctors friend and the quiet streetcorner was the sunny part of his life
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6390,6500,NA,On this certain fine Sunday Mr Lorry walked towards Soho early in the afternoon for three reasons of habit
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6502,6958,NA,Firstly because on fine Sundays he often walked out before dinner with the Doctor and Lucie secondly because on unfavourable Sundays he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend talking reading looking out of window and generally getting through the day thirdly because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve and knew how the ways of the Doctors household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6960,7047,NA,A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived was not to be found in London
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7049,7213,NA,There was no way through it and the front windows of the Doctors lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7215,7378,NA,There were few buildings then north of the Oxfordroad and foresttrees flourished and wild flowers grew and the hawthorn blossomed in the now vanished fields
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7380,7628,NA,As a consequence country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement and there was many a good south wall not far off on which the peaches ripened in their season
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7630,7862,NA,The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day but when the streets grew hot the corner was in shadow though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7864,7976,NA,It was a cool spot staid but cheerful a wonderful place for echoes and a very harbour from the raging streets
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7978,8054,NA,There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage and there was
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8056,8251,NA,The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house where several callings purported to be pursued by day but whereof little was audible any day and which was shunned by all of them at night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8253,8617,NA,In a building at the back attainable by a courtyard where a planetree rustled its green leaves churchorgans claimed to be made and silver to be chased and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hallas if he had beaten himself precious and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8619,8794,NA,Very little of these trades or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live upstairs or of a dim coachtrimming maker asserted to have a countinghouse below was ever heard or seen
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8796,8984,NA,Occasionally a stray workman putting his coat on traversed the hall or a stranger peered about there or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard or a thump from the golden giant
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8986,9205,NA,These however were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the planetree behind the house and the echoes in the corner before it had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9207,9339,NA,Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation and its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9341,9511,NA,His scientific knowledge and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate request and he earned as much as he wanted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9513,9682,NA,These things were within Mr Jarvis Lorrys knowledge thoughts and notice when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in the corner on the fine Sunday afternoon
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9684,9723,NA,Doctor Manette at home Expected home
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9725,9760,NA,Miss Lucie at home Expected home

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,221,368,NA,Simple as the furniture was it was set off by so many little adornments of no value but for their taste and fancy that its effect was delightful
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,370,858,NA,The disposition of everything in the rooms from the largest object to the least the arrangement of colours the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles by delicate hands clear eyes and good sense were at once so pleasant in themselves and so expressive of their originator that as Mr Lorry stood looking about him the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time whether he approved
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,860,1121,NA,There were three rooms on a floor and the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all Mr Lorry smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him walked from one to another
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1123,1631,NA,The first was the best room and in it were Lucies birds and flowers and books and desk and worktable and box of watercolours the second was the Doctors consultingroom used also as the diningroom the third changingly speckled by the rustle of the planetree in the yard was the Doctors bedroom and there in a corner stood the disused shoemakers bench and tray of tools much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wineshop in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1633,1818,NA,I wonder said Mr Lorry pausing in his looking about that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him And why wonder at that was the abrupt inquiry that made him start
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1820,1981,NA,It proceeded from Miss Pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover and had since improved
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1983,2024,NA,I should have thought Mr Lorry began
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2026,2031,NA,Pooh
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2033,2093,NA,Youd have thought said Miss Pross and Mr Lorry left off
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2095,2198,NA,How do you do inquired that lady thensharply and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2200,2281,NA,I am pretty well I thank you answered Mr Lorry with meekness how are you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2283,2321,NA,Nothing to boast of said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2323,2362,NA,Indeed Ah indeed said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2364,2406,NA,I am very much put out about my Ladybird
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2408,2578,NA,Indeed For gracious sake say something else besides indeed or youll fidget me to death said Miss Pross whose character dissociated from stature was shortness
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2580,2627,NA,Really then said Mr Lorry as an amendment
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2629,2686,NA,Really is bad enough returned Miss Pross but better
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2688,2739,NA,Yes I am very much put out May I ask the cause
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2741,2859,NA,I dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird to come here looking after her said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2861,2896,NA, Do  dozens come for that purpose
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2898,2925,NA,Hundreds said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2927,3087,NA,It was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned she exaggerated it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3089,3154,NA,Dear me said Mr Lorry as the safest remark he could think of
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3156,3409,NA,I have lived with the darlingor the darling has lived with me and paid me for it which she certainly should never have done you may take your affidavit if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothingsince she was ten years old
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3411,3455,NA,And its really very hard  said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3457,3614,NA,Not seeing with precision what was very hard Mr Lorry shook his head using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3616,3727,NA,All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet are always turning up said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3729,3790,NA,When you began it  I  began it Miss Pross Didnt you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3792,3828,NA,Who brought her father to life Oh
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3830,3874,NA,If  that  was beginning it said Mr Lorry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3876,3907,NA,It wasnt ending it I suppose
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3909,4167,NA,I say when you began it it was hard enough not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette except that he is not worthy of such a daughter which is no imputation on him for it was not to be expected that anybody should be under any circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4169,4342,NA,But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him I could have forgiven him to take Ladybirds affections away from me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4344,4792,NA,Mr Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous but he also knew her by this time to be beneath the service of her eccentricity one of those unselfish creaturesfound only among womenwho will for pure love and admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youth when they have lost it to beauty that they never had to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4794,5251,NA,He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint he had such an exalted respect for it that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mindwe all make such arrangements more or lesshe stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art who had balances at Tellsons
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5253,5404,NA,There never was nor will be but one man worthy of Ladybird said Miss Pross and that was my brother Solomon if he hadnt made a mistake in life
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5406,5710,NA,Here again Mr Lorrys inquiries into Miss Prosss personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed as a stake to speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore with no touch of compunction
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5712,5893,NA,Miss Prosss fidelity of belief in Solomon deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious matter with Mr Lorry and had its weight in his good opinion of her
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5895,6175,NA,As we happen to be alone for the moment and are both people of business he said when they had got back to the drawingroom and had sat down there in friendly relations let me ask youdoes the Doctor in talking with Lucie never refer to the shoemaking time yet Never

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6232,6275,NA,Ah returned Miss Pross shaking her head
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6277,6330,NA,But I dont say he dont refer to it within himself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6332,6374,NA,Do you believe that he thinks of it much
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6376,6399,NA,I do said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6401,6504,NA,Do you imagine Mr Lorry had begun when Miss Pross took him up short with Never imagine anything
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6506,6610,NA,Have no imagination at all I stand corrected do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose sometimes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6612,6643,NA,Now and then said Miss Pross
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6645,6928,NA,Do you suppose Mr Lorry went on with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye as it looked kindly at her that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own preserved through all those years relative to the cause of his being so oppressed perhaps even to the name of his oppressor
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6930,7035,NA,I dont suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me And that is That she thinks he has
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7037,7165,NA,Now dont be angry at my asking all these questions because I am a mere dull man of business and you are a woman of business
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7167,7173,NA,Dull
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7175,7210,NA,Miss Pross inquired with placidity
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7212,7284,NA,Rather wishing his modest adjective away Mr Lorry replied No no no
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7286,7296,NA,Surely not
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7298,7472,NA,To return to businessIs it not remarkable that Doctor Manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is should never touch upon that question
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7474,7690,NA,I will not say with me though he had business relations with me many years ago and we are now intimate I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached and who is so devotedly attached to him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7692,7799,NA,Believe me Miss Pross I dont approach the topic with you out of curiosity but out of zealous interest
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7801,7806,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7808,7967,NA,To the best of my understanding and bads the best youll tell me said Miss Pross softened by the tone of the apology he is afraid of the whole subject
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7969,8028,NA,Afraid Its plain enough I should think why he may be
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8030,8057,NA,Its a dreadful remembrance
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8059,8107,NA,Besides that his loss of himself grew out of it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8109,8224,NA,Not knowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may never feel certain of not losing himself again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8226,8288,NA,That alone wouldnt make the subject pleasant I should think
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8290,8346,NA,It was a profounder remark than Mr Lorry had looked for
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8348,8393,NA,True said he and fearful to reflect upon
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8395,8526,NA,Yet a doubt lurks in my mind Miss Pross whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8528,8637,NA,Indeed it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8639,8691,NA,Cant be helped said Miss Pross shaking her head
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8693,8751,NA,Touch that string and he instantly changes for the worse
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8753,8774,NA,Better leave it alone
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8776,8822,NA,In short must leave it alone like or no like
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8824,8966,NA,Sometimes he gets up in the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking up and down walking up and down in his room
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8968,9077,NA,Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down walking up and down in his old prison
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9079,9186,NA,She hurries to him and they go on together walking up and down walking up and down until he is composed
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9188,9307,NA,But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness to her and she finds it best not to hint at it to him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9309,9442,NA,In silence they go walking up and down together walking up and down together till her love and company have brought him to himself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9444,9686,NA,Notwithstanding Miss Prosss denial of her own imagination there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea in her repetition of the phrase walking up and down which testified to her possessing such a thing
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9688,9908,NA,The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,266,464,NA,Not only would the echoes die away as though the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,466,574,NA,However father and daughter did at last appear and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,576,972,NA,Miss Pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking off her darlings bonnet when she came upstairs and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1131,1236,NA,He had been there often during a whole year and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1238,1413,NA,When he cared to talk he talked well but the cloud of caring for nothing which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness was very rarely pierced by the light within him

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1544,1991,NA,Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things else forgotten and unattainable into his mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1993,2205,NA,Of late the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes he had got up again and haunted that neighbourhood

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3770,3856,NA,He knew her to be so without looking at her and said Pray forgive me Miss Manette

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5747,5936,NA,In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father and of this home made such a home by you has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5938,6132,NA,Since I knew you I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward that I thought were silent for ever

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,698,709,NA,CHAPTER XIV
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,711,915,NA,The Honest Tradesman To the eyes of Mr Jeremiah Cruncher sitting on his stool in Fleetstreet with his grisly urchin beside him a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,917,1229,NA,Who could sit upon anything in Fleetstreet during the busy hours of the day and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions one ever tending westward with the sun the other ever tending eastward from the sun both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1231,1453,NA,With his straw in his mouth Mr Cruncher sat watching the two streams like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one streamsaving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1455,1702,NA,Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from Tellsons side of the tides to the opposite shore
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1704,1907,NA,Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance Mr Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1909,2055,NA,And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose that he recruited his finances as just now observed
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2057,2144,NA,Time was when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place and mused in the sight of men
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2146,2269,NA,Mr Cruncher sitting on a stool in a public place but not being a poet mused as little as possible and looked about him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2271,2618,NA,It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few and belated women few and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs Cruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleetstreet westward attracted his attention
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2620,2781,NA,Looking that way Mr Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along and that there was popular objection to this funeral which engendered uproar
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2783,2859,NA,Young Jerry said Mr Cruncher turning to his offspring its a buryin

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3368,3446,NA,Dye hear I warnt doing no harm Young Jerry protested rubbing his cheek
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3448,3520,NA,Drop it then said Mr Cruncher I wont have none of  your  no harms
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3522,3574,NA,Get a top of that there seat and look at the crowd
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3576,3839,NA,His son obeyed and the crowd approached they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach in which mourning coach there was only one mourner dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3841,4032,NA,The position appeared by no means to please him however with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach deriding him making grimaces at him and incessantly groaning and calling out Yah

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5245,5487,NA,The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea that the crowd caught it up with eagerness and loudly repeating the suggestion to have em out and to pull em out mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5489,5822,NA,On the crowds opening the coach doors the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment but he was so alert and made such good use of his time that in another moment he was scouring away up a byestreet after shedding his cloak hat long hatband white pockethandkerchief and other symbolical tears
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5824,6034,NA,These the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monster much dreaded
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6036,6220,NA,They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out when some brighter genius proposed instead its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6222,6490,NA,Practical suggestions being much needed this suggestion too was received with acclamation and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6492,6672,NA,Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellsons in the further corner of the mourning coach
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6674,6953,NA,The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies but the river being alarmingly near and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason the protest was faint and brief
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6955,7215,NA,The remodelled procession started with a chimneysweep driving the hearseadvised by the regular driver who was perched beside him under close inspection for the purposeand with a pieman also attended by his cabinet minister driving the mourning coach
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7217,7487,NA,A bearleader a popular street character of the time was impressed as an additional ornament before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand and his bear who was black and very mangy gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7489,7682,NA,Thus with beerdrinking pipesmoking songroaring and infinite caricaturing of woe the disorderly procession went its way recruiting at every step and all the shops shutting up before it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7684,7758,NA,Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras far off in the fields
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7760,7948,NA,It got there in course of time insisted on pouring into the burialground finally accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way and highly to its own satisfaction
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7950,8217,NA,The dead man disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself another brighter genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual passersby as Old Bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8219,8406,NA,Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives in the realisation of this fancy and they were roughly hustled and maltreated
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8408,8523,NA,The transition to the sport of windowbreaking and thence to the plundering of publichouses was easy and natural
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8525,8727,NA,At last after several hours when sundry summerhouses had been pulled down and some arearailings had been torn up to arm the more belligerent spirits a rumour got about that the Guards were coming
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8729,8880,NA,Before this rumour the crowd gradually melted away and perhaps the Guards came and perhaps they never came and this was the usual progress of a mob
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8882,9018,NA,Mr Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports but had remained behind in the churchyard to confer and condole with the undertakers
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9020,9061,NA,The place had a soothing influence on him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9063,9191,NA,He procured a pipe from a neighbouring publichouse and smoked it looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9377,9538,NA,Having smoked his pipe out and ruminated a little longer he turned himself about that he might appear before the hour of closing on his station at Tellsons
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9540,9858,NA,Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man is not so much to the purpose as that he made a short call upon his medical advisera distinguished surgeonon his way back

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,758,924,NA,Mr Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations but made use of them as people not unfrequently do to express general ironical dissatisfaction
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,926,1090,NA,You and your yes Jerry said Mr Cruncher taking a bite out of his breadandbutter and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1674,1898,NA,He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs Cruncher and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1900,2142,NA,With this view he urged his son to hold her in conversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2144,2279,NA,The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2281,2364,NA,It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2366,2399,NA,And mind you said Mr Cruncher

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2859,2977,NA,I dont know how scarce you maynt make the wittles and drink here by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3143,3420,NA,This touched Young Jerry on a tender place who adjured his mother to perform her first duty and whatever else she did or neglected above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3422,3572,NA,Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family until Young Jerry was ordered to bed and his mother laid under similar injunctions obeyed them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3574,3711,NA,Mr Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one oclock
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3713,3946,NA,Towards that small and ghostly hour he rose up from his chair took a key out of his pocket opened a locked cupboard and brought forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size a rope and chain and other fishing tackle of that nature
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3948,4087,NA,Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs Cruncher extinguished the light and went out
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4089,4192,NA,Young Jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed was not long after his father
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4194,4331,NA,Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the court followed out into the streets
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4333,4463,NA,He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again for it was full of lodgers and the door stood ajar all night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4465,4697,NA,Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his fathers honest calling Young Jerry keeping as close to house fronts walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one another held his honoured parent in view
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4699,4844,NA,The honoured parent steering Northward had not gone far when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton and the two trudged on together
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4846,4994,NA,Within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond the winking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon a lonely road
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4996,5211,NA,Another fisherman was picked up hereand that so silently that if Young Jerry had been superstitious he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have all of a sudden split himself into two
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5213,5314,NA,The three went on and Young Jerry went on until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5316,5392,NA,Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall surmounted by an iron railing
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5394,5559,NA,In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which the wallthere risen to some eight or ten feet highformed one side
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5561,5767,NA,Crouching down in a corner peeping up the lane the next object that Young Jerry saw was the form of his honoured parent pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon nimbly scaling an iron gate
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5769,5845,NA,He was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the third
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5847,5943,NA,They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay there a littlelistening perhaps
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5945,5991,NA,Then they moved away on their hands and knees
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5993,6077,NA,It was now Young Jerrys turn to approach the gate which he did holding his breath
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6079,6397,NA,Crouching down again in a corner there and looking in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass and all the gravestones in the churchyardit was a large churchyard that they were inlooking on like ghosts in white while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6399,6460,NA,They did not creep far before they stopped and stood upright
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6462,6489,NA,And then they began to fish
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6491,6525,NA,They fished with a spade at first
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6527,6620,NA,Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6622,6800,NA,Whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry that he made off with his hair as stiff as his fathers
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6802,6933,NA,But his longcherished desire to know more about these matters not only stopped him in his running away but lured him back again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6935,7064,NA,They were still fishing perseveringly when he peeped in at the gate for the second time but now they seemed to have got a bite
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7066,7176,NA,There was a screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figures were strained as if by a weight
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7178,7258,NA,By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it and came to the surface

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1847,1966,NA,He gave his arm to his daughter and took her downstairs to the chariot which Mr Lorry had hired in honour of the day
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1968,2129,NA,The rest followed in another carriage and soon in a neighbouring church where no strange eyes looked on Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2131,2374,NA,Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling glanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr Lorrys pockets
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2376,2631,NA,They returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the Paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2633,2682,NA,It was a hard parting though it was not for long
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2684,2800,NA,But her father cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms Take her Charles
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2802,2815,NA,She is yours
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2817,2891,NA,And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was gone
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2893,3064,NA,The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the Doctor Mr Lorry and Miss Pross were left quite alone
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3066,3271,NA,It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall that Mr Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor as if the golden arm uplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3273,3398,NA,He had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3400,3662,NA,But it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr Lorry and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got upstairs Mr Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wineshop keeper and the starlight ride
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3664,3801,NA,I think he whispered to Miss Pross after anxious consideration I think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3803,3882,NA,I must look in at Tellsons so I will go there at once and come back presently
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3884,3969,NA,Then we will take him a ride into the country and dine there and all will be well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3971,4053,NA,It was easier for Mr Lorry to look in at Tellsons than to look out of Tellsons
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4055,4080,NA,He was detained two hours
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4082,4256,NA,When he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the Doctors rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4258,4291,NA,Good God he said with a start
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4293,4357,NA,Whats that Miss Pross with a terrified face was at his ear
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4359,4370,NA,O me O me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4372,4415,NA,All is lost cried she wringing her hands
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4417,4448,NA,What is to be told to Ladybird

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4492,4573,NA,Mr Lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the Doctors room
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4575,4729,NA,The bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4731,4746,NA,Doctor Manette
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4748,4779,NA,My dear friend Doctor Manette
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4781,4911,NA,The Doctor looked at him for a momenthalf inquiringly half as if he were angry at being spoken toand bent over his work again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4913,5097,NA,He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old haggard faded surface of face had come back to him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5099,5174,NA,He worked hardimpatientlyas if in some sense of having been interrupted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5176,5276,NA,Mr Lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5278,5341,NA,He took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5343,5405,NA,A young ladys walking shoe he muttered without looking up
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5407,5447,NA,It ought to have been finished long ago
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5449,5459,NA,Let it be
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5461,5481,NA,But Doctor Manette
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5483,5494,NA,Look at me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5496,5577,NA,He obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in his work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5579,5607,NA,You know me my dear friend
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5609,5620,NA,Think again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5622,5656,NA,This is not your proper occupation
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5658,5677,NA,Think dear friend
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5679,5717,NA,Nothing would induce him to speak more
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5719,5839,NA,He looked up for an instant at a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract a word from him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5841,5970,NA,He worked and worked and worked in silence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on the air
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5972,6086,NA,The only ray of hope that Mr Lorry could discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6088,6218,NA,In that there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexityas though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6220,6419,NA,Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr Lorry as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from Lucie the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6421,6592,NA,In conjunction with Miss Pross he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution by giving out that the Doctor was not well and required a few days of complete rest
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6594,6878,NA,In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter Miss Pross was to write describing his having been called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been addressed to her by the same post
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6880,6982,NA,These measures advisable to be taken in any case Mr Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6984,7130,NA,If that should happen soon he kept another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he thought the best on the Doctors case
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7132,7326,NA,In the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable Mr Lorry resolved to watch him attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7328,7472,NA,He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellsons for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7474,7595,NA,He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him since on being pressed he became worried
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7597,7777,NA,He abandoned that attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen or was falling
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7779,7951,NA,He remained therefore in his seat near the window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7953,8162,NA,Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to seeworked on half an hour after Mr Lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8164,8268,NA,When he put his tools aside as useless until morning Mr Lorry rose and said to him Will you go out
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8270,8434,NA,He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice Out Yes for a walk with me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8436,8444,NA,Why not
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8446,8504,NA,He made no effort to say why not and said not a word more
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8506,8695,NA,But Mr Lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in some misty way asking himself Why not
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8697,8787,NA,The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8789,8896,NA,Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8898,9012,NA,He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he fell asleep
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9014,9091,NA,In the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his bench and to work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9093,9224,NA,On this second day Mr Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9226,9344,NA,He returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and that he thought about it however confusedly
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9346,9581,NA,This encouraged Mr Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work several times during the day at those times they quietly spoke of Lucie and of her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing amiss
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9583,9856,NA,This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened Mr Lorrys friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9858,9944,NA,When it fell dark again Mr Lorry asked him as before Dear Doctor will you go out
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9946,10001,NA,As before he repeated Out Yes for a walk with me

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1,11,NA, Why not
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,13,143,NA,This time Mr Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,145,319,NA,In the meanwhile the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had sat there looking down at the planetree but on Mr Lorrys return he slipped away to his bench
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,321,458,NA,The time went very slowly on and Mr Lorrys hope darkened and his heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,460,510,NA,The third day came and went the fourth the fifth
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,512,566,NA,Five days six days seven days eight days nine days
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,568,691,NA,With a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier Mr Lorry passed through this anxious time
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,693,1025,NA,The secret was well kept and Lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1027,1038,NA,CHAPTER XIX
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1040,1114,NA,An Opinion Worn out by anxious watching Mr Lorry fell asleep at his post
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1116,1272,NA,On the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1274,1381,NA,He rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had done so whether he was not still asleep
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1383,1568,NA,For going to the door of the Doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench and tools were put aside again and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1570,1715,NA,He was in his usual morning dress and his face which Mr Lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly studious and attentive
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1717,2131,NA,Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake Mr Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2133,2221,NA,It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2223,2337,NA,If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause how came he Jarvis Lorry there
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2339,2525,NA,How came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in Doctor Manettes consultingroom and to be debating these points outside the Doctors bedroom door in the early morning
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2527,2588,NA,Within a few minutes Miss Pross stood whispering at his side
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2590,2728,NA,If he had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have resolved it but he was by that time clearheaded and had none
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2730,2877,NA,He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfasthour and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2879,3069,NA,If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind Mr Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3071,3154,NA,Miss Pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked out with care
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3156,3319,NA,Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette Mr Lorry presented himself at the breakfasthour in his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3321,3384,NA,The Doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3386,3614,NA,So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr Lorry felt to be the only safe advance he at first supposed that his daughters marriage had taken place yesterday
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3616,3772,NA,An incidental allusion purposely thrown out to the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3774,3887,NA,In all other respects however he was so composedly himself that Mr Lorry determined to have the aid he sought
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3889,3913,NA,And that aid was his own
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3915,4261,NA,Therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the Doctor were left together Mr Lorry said feelingly My dear Manette I am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested that is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4263,4379,NA,Glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the Doctor looked troubled and listened attentively
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4381,4431,NA,He had already glanced at his hands more than once
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4433,4566,NA,Doctor Manette said Mr Lorry touching him affectionately on the arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4568,4695,NA,Pray give your mind to it and advise me well for his sakeand above all for his daughtershis daughters my dear Manette
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4697,4812,NA,If I understand said the Doctor in a subdued tone some mental shock Yes Be explicit said the Doctor
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4814,4831,NA,Spare no detail
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4833,4894,NA,Mr Lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4896,5064,NA,My dear Manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings thetheas you express itthe mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5066,5074,NA,The mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5076,5273,NA,It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how long because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there are no other means of getting at it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5275,5435,NA,It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace himselfas I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5437,5704,NA,It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was already very large
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5706,5795,NA,But unfortunately there has been he paused and took a deep breatha slight relapse
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5797,5854,NA,The Doctor in a low voice asked Of how long duration
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5856,5878,NA,Nine days and nights
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5880,5903,NA,How did it show itself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5905,6008,NA,I infer glancing at his hands again in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6010,6028,NA,That is the fact
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6030,6179,NA,Now did you ever see him asked the Doctor distinctly and collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit originally Once
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6181,6303,NA,And when the relapse fell on him was he in most respectsor in all respectsas he was then I think in all respects
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6305,6331,NA,You spoke of his daughter
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6333,6376,NA,Does his daughter know of the relapse No
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6378,6444,NA,It has been kept from her and I hope will always be kept from her
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6446,6510,NA,It is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6512,6574,NA,The Doctor grasped his hand and murmured That was very kind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6576,6601,NA,That was very thoughtful
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6603,6688,NA,Mr Lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a little while
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6690,6881,NA,Now my dear Manette said Mr Lorry at length in his most considerate and most affectionate way I am a mere man of business and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6883,6992,NA,I do not possess the kind of information necessary I do not possess the kind of intelligence I want guiding
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6994,7077,NA,There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance as on you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7079,7120,NA,Tell me how does this relapse come about
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7122,7148,NA,Is there danger of another
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7150,7187,NA,Could a repetition of it be prevented
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7189,7229,NA,How should a repetition of it be treated
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7231,7260,NA,How does it come about at all
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7262,7289,NA,What can I do for my friend
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7291,7401,NA,No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than I am to serve mine if I knew how
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7403,7453,NA,But I dont know how to originate in such a case
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7455,7612,NA,If your sagacity knowledge and experience could put me on the right track I might be able to do so much unenlightened and undirected I can do so little
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7614,7731,NA,Pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly and teach me how to be a little more useful
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7733,7833,NA,Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and Mr Lorry did not press him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7835,8002,NA,I think it probable said the Doctor breaking silence with an effort that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite unforeseen by its subject
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8004,8027,NA,Was it dreaded by him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8029,8054,NA,Mr Lorry ventured to ask
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8056,8067,NA,Very much
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8069,8107,NA,He said it with an involuntary shudder
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8109,8307,NA,You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers mind and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8309,8454,NA,Would he asked Mr Lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8456,8467,NA,I think so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8469,8518,NA,But it is as I have told you next to impossible
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8520,8577,NA,I even believe itin some casesto be quite impossible
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8579,8726,NA,Now said Mr Lorry gently laying his hand on the Doctors arm again after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this attack
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8728,8900,NA,I believe returned Doctor Manette that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8902,8987,NA,Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled I think
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8989,9164,NA,It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations would be recalledsay under certain circumstancessay on a particular occasion
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9166,9271,NA,He tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9273,9365,NA,Would he remember what took place in the relapse asked Mr Lorry with natural hesitation
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9367,9513,NA,The Doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and answered in a low voice Not at all Now as to the future hinted Mr Lorry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9515,9598,NA,As to the future said the Doctor recovering firmness I should have great hope
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9600,9682,NA,As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon I should have great hope
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9684,9897,NA,He yielding under the pressure of a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed I should hope that the worst was over
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9899,9910,NA,Well well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9912,9931,NA,Thats good comfort
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9933,9963,NA,I am thankful said Mr Lorry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9965,9980,NA,I am thankful

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1,34,NA, bending his head with reverence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,36,121,NA,There are two other points said Mr Lorry on which I am anxious to be instructed
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,123,135,NA,I may go on
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,137,181,NA,You cannot do your friend a better service
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,183,211,NA,The Doctor gave him his hand
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,213,232,NA,To the first then
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,234,417,NA,He is of a studious habit and unusually energetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,419,444,NA,Now does he do too much
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,446,458,NA,I think not
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,460,540,NA,It may be the character of his mind to be always in singular need of occupation
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,542,612,NA,That may be in part natural to it in part the result of affliction
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,614,728,NA,The less it was occupied with healthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,730,783,NA,He may have observed himself and made the discovery
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,785,839,NA,You are sure that he is not under too great a strain
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,841,872,NA,I think I am quite sure of it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,874,968,NA,My dear Manette if he were overworked now My dear Lorry I doubt if that could easily be
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,970,1049,NA,There has been a violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1051,1094,NA,Excuse me as a persistent man of business
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1096,1199,NA,Assuming for a moment that he  was  overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1201,1219,NA,I do not think so
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1221,1358,NA,I do not think said Doctor Manette with the firmness of selfconviction that anything but the one train of association would renew it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1360,1453,NA,I think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1455,1581,NA,After what has happened and after his recovery I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1583,1670,NA,I trust and I almost believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1672,1899,NA,He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1901,1951,NA,It was not for his friend to abate that confidence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1953,2063,NA,He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was and approached his second and last point
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2065,2263,NA,He felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2265,2452,NA,The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from said Mr Lorry clearing his throat we will callBlacksmiths work Blacksmiths work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2454,2580,NA,We will say to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad time to work at a little forge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2582,2643,NA,We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2645,2692,NA,Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2694,2781,NA,The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervously on the ground
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2783,2865,NA,He has always kept it by him said Mr Lorry with an anxious look at his friend
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2867,2921,NA,Now would it not be better that he should let it go
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2923,3001,NA,Still the Doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the ground
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3003,3057,NA,You do not find it easy to advise me said Mr Lorry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3059,3103,NA,I quite understand it to be a nice question
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3105,3164,NA,And yet I think And there he shook his head and stopped
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3166,3325,NA,You see said Doctor Manette turning to him after an uneasy pause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings of this poor mans mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3327,3736,NA,He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3738,4039,NA,Even now when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4041,4115,NA,He looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to Mr Lorrys face
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4117,4135,NA,But may notmind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4137,4339,NA,I ask for information as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and banknotesmay not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4341,4411,NA,If the thing were gone my dear Manette might not the fear go with it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4413,4482,NA,In short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the forge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4484,4509,NA,There was another silence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4511,4586,NA,You see too said the Doctor tremulously it is such an old companion
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4588,4702,NA,I would not keep it said Mr Lorry shaking his head for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4704,4742,NA,I would recommend him to sacrifice it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4744,4770,NA,I only want your authority
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4772,4797,NA,I am sure it does no good
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4799,4849,NA,Come Give me your authority like a dear good man
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4851,4950,NA,For his daughters sake my dear Manette Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4952,5001,NA,In her name then let it be done I sanction it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5003,5053,NA,But I would not take it away while he was present
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5055,5143,NA,Let it be removed when he is not there let him miss his old companion after an absence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5145,5209,NA,Mr Lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5211,5280,NA,They passed the day in the country and the Doctor was quite restored
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5282,5406,NA,On the three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5408,5590,NA,The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence Mr Lorry had previously explained to him and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it and she had no suspicions
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5592,5753,NA,On the night of the day on which he left the house Mr Lorry went into his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by Miss Pross carrying a light
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5755,6005,NA,There with closed doors and in a mysterious and guilty manner Mr Lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murderfor which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6007,6198,NA,The burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire and the tools shoes and leather were buried in the garden
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6200,6440,NA,So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds that Mr Lorry and Miss Pross while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible crime
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6442,6452,NA,CHAPTER XX
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6454,6578,NA,A Plea When the newlymarried pair came home the first person who appeared to offer his congratulations was Sydney Carton
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6580,6643,NA,They had not been at home many hours when he presented himself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6645,6811,NA,He was not improved in habits or in looks or in manner but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6813,6922,NA,He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window and of speaking to him when no one overheard
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6924,6927,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6929,6979,NA,Darnay said Carton I wish we might be friends

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7015,7110,NA,You are good enough to say so as a fashion of speech but I dont mean any fashion of speech
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7112,7194,NA,Indeed when I say I wish we might be friends I scarcely mean quite that either
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7196,7295,NA,Charles Darnayas was naturalasked him in all goodhumour and goodfellowship what he did mean
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7297,7408,NA,Upon my life said Carton smiling I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind than to convey to yours
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7410,7429,NA,However let me try
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7431,7606,NA,You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk thanthan usual I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7608,7626,NA,I remember it too
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7628,7701,NA,The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me for I always remember them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7703,7782,NA,I hope it may be taken into account one day when all days are at an end for me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7784,7827,NA,Dont be alarmed I am not going to preach
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7829,7853,NA,I am not at all alarmed
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7855,7985,NA,Earnestness in you is anything but alarming to me Ah said Carton with a careless wave of his hand as if he waved that away
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7987,8117,NA,On the drunken occasion in question one of a large number as you know I was insufferable about liking you and not liking you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8119,8146,NA,I wish you would forget it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8148,8170,NA,I forgot it long ago
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8172,8196,NA,Fashion of speech again
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8198,8278,NA,But Mr Darnay oblivion is not so easy to me as you represent it to be to you
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8280,8362,NA,I have by no means forgotten it and a light answer does not help me to forget it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8364,8439,NA,If it was a light answer returned Darnay I beg your forgiveness for it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8441,8551,NA,I had no other object than to turn a slight thing which to my surprise seems to trouble you too much aside
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8553,8642,NA,I declare to you on the faith of a gentleman that I have long dismissed it from my mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8644,8682,NA,Good Heaven what was there to dismiss
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8684,8992,NA,Have I had nothing more important to remember in the great service you rendered me that day As to the great service said Carton I am bound to avow to you when you speak of it in that way that it was mere professional claptrap I dont know that I cared what became of you when I rendered itMind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8994,9046,NA,I say when I rendered it I am speaking of the past
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9048,9150,NA,You make light of the obligation returned Darnay but I will not quarrel with  your  light answer
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9152,9188,NA,Genuine truth Mr Darnay trust me
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9190,9263,NA,I have gone aside from my purpose I was speaking about our being friends
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9265,9350,NA,Now you know me you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9352,9470,NA,If you doubt it ask Stryver and hell tell you so I prefer to form my own opinion without the aid of his Well
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9472,9560,NA,At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog who has never done any good and never will
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9562,9598,NA,I dont know that you never will
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9600,9643,NA,But I do and you must take my word for it

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,586,831,NA,When he was gone and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross the Doctor and Mr Lorry Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,833,960,NA,He spoke of him in short not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,962,1182,NA,He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife but when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1569,1734,NA,What will I not promise to my Love What indeed with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek and his other hand against the heart that beat for him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1736,1847,NA,I think Charles poor Mr Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him tonight
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1849,1864,NA,Indeed my own

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2624,2765,NA,The escort were so wretchedly clothed that they twisted straw round their bare legs and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2767,3298,NA,Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk and carrying his musket very recklessly Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast for he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated and of representations confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye that were not yet made
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3300,3492,NA,But when they came to the town of Beauvaiswhich they did at eventide when the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3952,4106,NA,The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the riders bridle at which he was evidently making and soothingly said Let him be let him be
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4108,4188,NA,He will be judged at Paris Judged repeated the farrier swinging his hammer
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4190,4222,NA,Ay and condemned as a traitor
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4224,4257,NA,At this the crowd roared approval
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4259,4535,NA,Checking the postmaster who was for turning his horses head to the yard the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on with the line round his wrist Darnay said as soon as he could make his voice heard Friends you deceive yourselves or you are deceived
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4537,4556,NA,I am not a traitor
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4558,4584,NA,He lies cried the smith

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4689,4958,NA,At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd which another instant would have brought upon him the postmaster turned his horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon his horses flanks and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4960,5057,NA,The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer and the crowd groaned but no more was done
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5059,5104,NA,What is this decree that the smith spoke of
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5106,5192,NA,Darnay asked the postmaster when he had thanked him and stood beside him in the yard
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5194,5249,NA,Truly a decree for selling the property of emigrants

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5717,5840,NA,They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5842,5979,NA,Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5981,6313,NA,After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster of poor cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering with lights and would find the people in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6315,6760,NA,Happily however there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness jingling through the untimely cold and wet among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade and sharp reining up across their way of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6762,6814,NA,Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6816,6883,NA,The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7264,7376,NA,Where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of him whatever are the papers of this prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7378,7436,NA,The drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7438,7588,NA,Casting his eyes over Gabelles letter the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise and looked at Darnay with a close attention
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7590,7734,NA,He left escort and escorted without saying a word however and went into the guardroom meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside the gate
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7736,8111,NA,Looking about him while in this state of suspense Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots the latter far outnumbering the former and that while ingress into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies and for similar traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even for the homeliest people was very difficult
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8113,8328,NA,A numerous medley of men and women not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts was waiting to issue forth but the previous identification was so strict that they filtered through the barrier very slowly
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8330,8500,NA,Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke while others talked together or loitered about
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8502,8577,NA,The red cap and tricolour cockade were universal both among men and women
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8579,8758,NA,When he had sat in his saddle some halfhour taking note of these things Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority who directed the guard to open the barrier
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8760,8867,NA,Then he delivered to the escort drunk and sober a receipt for the escorted and requested him to dismount
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8869,8973,NA,He did so and the two patriots leading his tired horse turned and rode away without entering the city
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8975,9246,NA,He accompanied his conductor into a guardroom smelling of common wine and tobacco where certain soldiers and patriots asleep and awake drunk and sober and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking drunkenness and sobriety were standing and lying about
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9248,9407,NA,The light in the guardhouse half derived from the waning oillamps of the night and half from the overcast day was in a correspondingly uncertain condition
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9409,9511,NA,Some registers were lying open on a desk and an officer of a coarse dark aspect presided over these
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9513,9601,NA,Citizen Defarge said he to Darnays conductor as he took a slip of paper to write on

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1136,1374,NA,Yes The word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge to say with sudden impatience In the name of that sharp female newlyborn and called La Guillotine why did you come to France You heard me say why a minute ago
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1376,1411,NA,Do you not believe it is the truth
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1413,1510,NA,A bad truth for you said Defarge speaking with knitted brows and looking straight before him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1512,1534,NA,Indeed I am lost here
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1536,1625,NA,All here is so unprecedented so changed so sudden and unfair that I am absolutely lost

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1721,1759,NA,Will you answer me a single question
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1761,1769,NA,Perhaps
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1771,1794,NA,According to its nature
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1796,1819,NA,You can say what it is

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2136,2170,NA,But never by me Citizen Defarge
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2172,2255,NA,Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer and walked on in a steady and set silence
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2257,2382,NA,The deeper he sank into this silence the fainter hope there wasor so Darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2384,2717,NA,He therefore made haste to say It is of the utmost importance to me you know Citizen even better than I of how much importance that I should be able to communicate to Mr Lorry of Tellsons Bank an English gentleman who is now in Paris the simple fact without comment that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2719,2815,NA,Will you cause that to be done for me I will do Defarge doggedly rejoined nothing for you

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2931,3020,NA,Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and his pride was touched besides
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3022,3153,NA,As they walked on in silence he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3155,3193,NA,The very children scarcely noticed him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3195,3435,NA,A few passers turned their heads and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat otherwise that a man in good clothes should be going to prison was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3437,3642,NA,In one narrow dark and dirty street through which they passed an excited orator mounted on a stool was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people of the king and the royal family
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3644,3821,NA,The few words that he caught from this mans lips first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3823,3887,NA,On the road except at Beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3889,3958,NA,The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3960,4090,NA,That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England he of course knew now
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4092,4196,NA,That perils had thickened about him fast and might thicken faster and faster yet he of course knew now
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4198,4324,NA,He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey if he could have foreseen the events of a few days
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4326,4429,NA,And yet his misgivings were not so dark as imagined by the light of this later time they would appear
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4431,4530,NA,Troubled as the future was it was the unknown future and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4532,4774,NA,The horrible massacre days and nights long which within a few rounds of the clock was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4776,4897,NA,The sharp female newlyborn and called La Guillotine was hardly known to him or to the generality of people by name
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4899,5010,NA,The frightful deeds that were to be soon done were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5012,5083,NA,How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5085,5278,NA,Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship and in cruel separation from his wife and child he foreshadowed the likelihood or the certainty but beyond this he dreaded nothing distinctly
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5280,5397,NA,With this on his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard he arrived at the prison of La Force
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5399,5501,NA,A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whom Defarge presented The Emigrant Evrémonde
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5503,5518,NA,What the Devil
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5520,5583,NA,How many more of them exclaimed the man with the bloated face
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5585,5686,NA,Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation and withdrew with his two fellowpatriots
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5688,5759,NA,What the Devil I say again exclaimed the gaoler left with his wife
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5761,5776,NA,How many more
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5778,6077,NA,The gaolers wife being provided with no answer to the question merely replied One must have patience my dear Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment and one added For the love of Liberty which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6079,6185,NA,The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6187,6309,NA,Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6311,6378,NA,In secret too grumbled the gaoler looking at the written paper
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6380,6422,NA,As if I was not already full to bursting
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6424,6717,NA,He stuck the paper on a file in an illhumour and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour sometimes pacing to and fro in the strong arched room sometimes resting on a stone seat in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6719,6797,NA,Come said the chief at length taking up his keys come with me emigrant
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6799,7026,NA,Through the dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase many doors clanging and locking behind them until they came into a large low vaulted chamber crowded with prisoners of both sexes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7028,7218,NA,The women were seated at a long table reading and writing knitting sewing and embroidering the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs or lingering up and down the room
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7220,7338,NA,In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace the newcomer recoiled from this company
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7340,7544,NA,But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride was their all at once rising to receive him with every refinement of manner known to the time and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7546,7781,NA,So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7783,7793,NA,Ghosts all
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7795,8102,NA,The ghost of beauty the ghost of stateliness the ghost of elegance the ghost of pride the ghost of frivolity the ghost of wit the ghost of youth the ghost of age all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8104,8128,NA,It struck him motionless
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8130,8609,NA,The gaoler standing at his side and the other gaolers moving about who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were therewith the apparitions of the coquette the young beauty and the mature woman delicately bredthat the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented was heightened to its utmost
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8611,8629,NA,Surely ghosts all
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8631,8728,NA,Surely the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8730,8980,NA,In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address coming forward I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8982,9011,NA,May it soon terminate happily
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9013,9106,NA,It would be an impertinence elsewhere but it is not so here to ask your name and condition
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9108,9211,NA,Charles Darnay roused himself and gave the required information in words as suitable as he could find
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9213,9439,NA,But I hope said the gentleman following the chief gaoler with his eyes who moved across the room that you are not in secret I do not understand the meaning of the term but I have heard them say so Ah what a pity
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9441,9461,NA,We so much regret it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9463,9578,NA,But take courage several members of our society have been in secret at first and it has lasted but a short time
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9580,9657,NA,Then he added raising his voice I grieve to inform the societyin secret
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9659,9906,NA,There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him and many voicesamong which the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,9908,10001,NA,He turned at the grated door to render the thanks of his heart it closed under the gaolers

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,117,277,NA,When they had ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already counted them the gaoler opened a low black door and they passed into a solitary cell
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,279,320,NA,It struck cold and damp but was not dark
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,322,346,NA,Yours said the gaoler
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,348,373,NA,Why am I confined alone
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,375,448,NA,How do I know I can buy pen ink and paper Such are not my orders
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,450,487,NA,You will be visited and can ask then
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,489,541,NA,At present you may buy your food and nothing more
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,543,605,NA,There were in the cell a chair a table and a straw mattress
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,607,944,NA,As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects and of the four walls before going out a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated both in face and person as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,946,1044,NA,When the gaoler was gone he thought in the same wandering way Now am I left as if I were dead
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1046,1228,NA,Stopping then to look down at the mattress he turned from it with a sick feeling and thought And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1230,1323,NA,Five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1325,1486,NA,The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell counting its measurement and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1488,1533,NA,He made shoes he made shoes he made shoes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1535,1650,NA,The prisoner counted the measurement again and paced faster to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1652,1700,NA,The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1702,1991,NA,There was one among them the appearance of a lady dressed in black who was leaning in the embrasure of a window and she had a light shining upon her golden hair and she looked like     Let us ride on again for Gods sake through the illuminated villages with the people all awake
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1993,2044,NA,    He made shoes he made shoes he made shoes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2046,2084,NA,    Five paces by four and a half
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2086,2401,NA,With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind the prisoner walked faster and faster obstinately counting and counting and the roar of the city changed to this extentthat it still rolled in like muffled drums but with the wail of voices that he knew in the swell that rose above them
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2403,2413,NA,CHAPTER II
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2415,2616,NA,The Grindstone Tellsons Bank established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris was in a wing of a large house approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2618,2770,NA,The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles in his own cooks dress and got across the borders
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2772,3003,NA,A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3005,3339,NA,Monseigneur gone and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty Equality Fraternity or Death Monseigneurs house had been first sequestrated and then confiscated
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3341,3655,NA,For all things moved so fast and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneurs house and had marked it with the tricolour and were drinking brandy in its state apartments
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3657,3799,NA,A place of business in London like Tellsons place of business in Paris would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3801,3957,NA,For what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orangetrees in boxes in a Bank courtyard and even to a Cupid over the counter
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3959,3979,NA,Yet such things were
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3981,4145,NA,Tellsons had whitewashed the Cupid but he was still to be seen on the ceiling in the coolest linen aiming as he very often does at money from morning to night
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4147,4427,NA,Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan in Lombardstreet London and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy and also of a lookingglass let into the wall and also of clerks not at all old who danced in public on the slightest provocation
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4429,4599,NA,Yet a French Tellsons could get on with these things exceedingly well and as long as the times held together no man had taken fright at them and drawn out his money
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4601,5075,NA,What money would be drawn out of Tellsons henceforth and what would lie there lost and forgotten what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellsons hidingplaces while the depositors rusted in prisons and when they should have violently perished how many accounts with Tellsons never to be balanced in this world must be carried over into the next no man could have said that night any more than Mr Jarvis Lorry could though he thought heavily of these questions
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5077,5332,NA,He sat by a newlylighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw or any object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5334,5450,NA,He occupied rooms in the Bank in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part like strong rootivy
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5452,5614,NA,It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building but the truehearted old gentleman never calculated about that
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5616,5687,NA,All such circumstances were indifferent to him so that he did his duty
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5689,5840,NA,On the opposite side of the courtyard under a colonnade was extensive standingfor carriageswhere indeed some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5842,6117,NA,Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux and in the light of these standing out in the open air was a large grindstone a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy or other workshop
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6119,6234,NA,Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects Mr Lorry shivered and retired to his seat by the fire
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6236,6375,NA,He had opened not only the glass window but the lattice blind outside it and he had closed both again and he shivered through his frame
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6377,6619,NA,From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate there came the usual night hum of the city with now and then an indescribable ring in it weird and unearthly as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6621,6736,NA,Thank God said Mr Lorry clasping his hands that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town tonight
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6738,6781,NA,May He have mercy on all who are in danger
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6783,6892,NA,Soon afterwards the bell at the great gate sounded and he thought They have come back and sat listening
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,6894,7019,NA,But there was no loud irruption into the courtyard as he had expected and he heard the gate clash again and all was quiet
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7021,7188,NA,The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank which a great change would naturally awaken with such feelings roused
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7190,7378,NA,It was well guarded and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it when his door suddenly opened and two figures rushed in at sight of which he fell back in amazement
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7380,7400,NA,Lucie and her father
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7402,7645,NA,Lucie with her arms stretched out to him and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7647,7703,NA,What is this cried Mr Lorry breathless and confused
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7705,7724,NA,What is the matter
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7726,7731,NA,Lucie
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7733,7740,NA,Manette

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7801,7919,NA,With the look fixed upon him in her paleness and wildness she panted out in his arms imploringly O my dear friend

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,7968,7992,NA,What of Charles Here

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8213,8253,NA,The old man uttered an irrepressible cry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8255,8388,NA,Almost at the same moment the bell of the great gate rang again and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8390,8455,NA,What is that noise said the Doctor turning towards the window
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8457,8486,NA,Dont look cried Mr Lorry
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8488,8503,NA,Dont look out
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8505,8551,NA,Manette for your life dont touch the blind
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8553,8706,NA,The Doctor turned with his hand upon the fastening of the window and said with a cool bold smile My dear friend I have a charmed life in this city
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8708,8739,NA,I have been a Bastille prisoner
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,8741,8779,NA,There is no patriot in Parisin Paris

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5698,5871,NA,She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection and with Sydneys friendly reassurances adequately to heed what she observed

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,832,900,NA,Mr Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,902,1343,NA,Thrown out of his honourable employment in England through too much unsuccessful hard swearing therenot because he was not wanted there our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern datehe knew that he had crossed the Channel and accepted service in France first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1345,1736,NA,He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarges wineshop had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manettes imprisonment release and history as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges and tried them on Madame Defarge and had broken down with them signally
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1738,1898,NA,He always remembered with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,1900,2078,NA,He had since seen her in the Section of Saint Antoine over and over again produce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2080,2364,NA,He knew as every one employed as he was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror a word might bring it down upon him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2366,2629,NA,Once denounced and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs would produce against him that fatal register and would quash his last chance of life
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2631,2800,NA,Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2802,2881,NA,You scarcely seem to like your hand said Sydney with the greatest composure
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,2883,3200,NA,Do you play I think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to Mr Lorry I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence to put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3202,3551,NA,I admit that  I  am a spy and that it is considered a discreditable stationthough it must be filled by somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one I play my Ace Mr Barsad said Carton taking the answer on himself and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very few minutes
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3553,3817,NA,I should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving to hook Mr Lorry into the discussion that your respect for my sister I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother said Sydney Carton
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3819,3885,NA,You think not sir I have thoroughly made up my mind about it
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,3887,4165,NA,The smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour received such a check from the inscrutability of Cartonwho was a mystery to wiser and honester men than hethat it faltered here and failed him
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,4167,4365,NA,While he was at a loss Carton said resuming his former air of contemplating cards And indeed now I think again I have a strong impression that I have another good card here not yet enumerated

"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5706,5841,NA,His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains but I helped to lay him in his coffin
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5843,5938,NA,Here Mr Lorry became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall
"Dickens, Charles",A Tale of Two Cities,sentence,5940,6098,NA,Tracing it to its source he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr Crunchers head

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1115,1165,NA,So I called myself Pip and came to be called Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1167,1261,NA,I give Pirrip as my fathers family name on the authority of his tombstone and my sisterMrs

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1304,1541,NA,As I never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of either of them for their days were long before the days of photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2383,2526,NA,My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2528,3235,NA,At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and that Philip Pirrip late of this parish and also Georgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that Alexander Bartholomew Abraham Tobias and Roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle feeding on it was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3237,3353,NA,Hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4925,5097,NA,I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldnt and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it partly to keep myself from crying

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6443,6650,NA,I was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands and said If you would kindly please to let me keep upright sir perhaps I shouldnt be sick and perhaps I could attend more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6652,6745,NA,He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped over its own weathercock
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6747,6928,NA,Then he held me by the arms in an upright position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms You bring me tomorrow morning early that file and them wittles

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8542,8696,NA,At the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his armsclasping himself as if to hold himself togetherand limped towards the low church wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8698,8972,NA,As I saw him go picking his way among the nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8974,9108,NA,When he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,92,229,NA,The man was limping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come down and going back to hook himself up again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,231,378,NA,It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him I wondered whether they thought so too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,380,456,NA,I looked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,458,519,NA,But now I was frightened again and ran home without stopping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,521,531,NA,Chapter II
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,533,713,NA,My sister Mrs Joe Gargery was more than twenty years older than I and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up by hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,715,972,NA,Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,974,1103,NA,She was not a goodlooking woman my sister and I had a general impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1105,1292,NA,Joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1294,1425,NA,He was a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dear fellowa sort of Hercules in strength and also in weakness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1427,1623,NA,My sister Mrs Joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1625,1820,NA,She was tall and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1822,1930,NA,She made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against Joe that she wore this apron so much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1932,2088,NA,Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2090,2220,NA,Joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our country weremost of them at that time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2222,2322,NA,When I ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2324,2531,NA,Joe and I being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such Joe imparted a confidence to me the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2939,3035,NA,She sot down said Joe and she got up and she made a grab at Tickler and she Rampaged out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3037,3288,NA,Thats what she did said Joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it she Rampaged out Pip Has she been gone long Joe I always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3290,3409,NA,Well said Joe glancing up at the Dutch clock shes been on the Rampage this last spell about five minutes Pip

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3684,3880,NA,She concluded by throwing meI often served as a connubial missileat Joe who glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3882,3955,NA,Where have you been you young monkey said Mrs Joe stamping her foot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3957,4138,NA,Tell me directly what youve been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit or Id have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips and he was five hundred Gargerys

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4056,4147,NA,Therefore I naturally pointed to Mrs Joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4149,4278,NA,But Joe wouldnt hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8123,8430,NA,I was nearly going away without the pie but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner and I found it was the pie and I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use and would not be missed for some time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8432,8567,NA,There was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge I unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among Joes tools

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,828,1048,NA,However in the confusion of the mist I found myself at last too far to the right and consequently had to try back along the riverside on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4813,4882,NA,The Church not being thrown open he was as I have said our clerk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4884,5128,NA,But he punished the Amens tremendously and when he gave out the psalmalways giving the whole versehe looked all round the congregation first as much as to say You have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this style

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2129,2483,NA,and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed and all the high places I had tumbled from and all the low places I had tumbled into and all the injuries I had done myself and all the times she had wished me in my grave and I had contumaciously refused to go there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2485,2564,NA,I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much with their noses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2566,2632,NA,Perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2634,2775,NA,Anyhow Mr Wopsles Roman nose so aggravated me during the recital of my misdemeanours that I should have liked to pull it until he howled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2777,3067,NA,But all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sisters recital and in which pause everybody had looked at me as I felt painfully conscious with indignation and abhorrence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3069,3219,NA,Yet said Mr Pumblechook leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed Porkregarded as biledis rich too aint it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3822,4012,NA,Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet I saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink the brandy off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4014,4375,NA,Instantly afterwards the company were seized with unspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his feet turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whoopingcough dance and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window violently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous faces and apparently out of his mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4377,4427,NA,I held on tight while Mrs Joe and Joe ran to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4429,4507,NA,I didnt know how I had done it but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4509,4711,NA,In my dreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and surveying the company all round as if  they  had disagreed with him sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp Tar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4713,4762,NA,I had filled up the bottle from the tarwater jug
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4764,4798,NA,I knew he would be worse by and by
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4800,4891,NA,I moved the table like a Medium of the present day by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4893,4929,NA,Tar cried my sister in amazement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4931,4967,NA,Why how ever could Tar come there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4969,5159,NA,But Uncle Pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldnt hear the word wouldnt hear of the subject imperiously waved it all away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5161,5327,NA,My sister who had begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemonpeel and mixing them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5329,5369,NA,For the time being at least I was saved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5371,5460,NA,I still held on to the leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5462,5537,NA,By degrees I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5539,5573,NA,Mr Pumblechook partook of pudding
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5575,5597,NA,All partook of pudding
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5599,5703,NA,The course terminated and Mr Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5705,5797,NA,I began to think I should get over the day when my sister said to Joe Clean platescold
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5799,5942,NA,I clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5944,6014,NA,I foresaw what was coming and I felt that this time I really was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6016,6199,NA,You must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best graceyou must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious present of Uncle Pumblechooks Must they
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6201,6230,NA,Let them not hope to taste it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6232,6304,NA,You must know said my sister rising its a pie a savory pork pie
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6306,6344,NA,The company murmured their compliments
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6346,6553,NA,Uncle Pumblechook sensible of having deserved well of his fellowcreatures saidquite vivaciously all things consideredWell Mrs Joe well do our best endeavours let us have a cut at this same pie

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6585,6624,NA,I heard her steps proceed to the pantry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6626,6665,NA,I saw Mr Pumblechook balance his knife
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6667,6729,NA,I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6731,6898,NA,I heard Mr Hubble remark that a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do no harm and I heard Joe say You shall have some Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6900,7037,NA,I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror merely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7039,7097,NA,I felt that I could bear no more and that I must run away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7099,7151,NA,I released the leg of the table and ran for my life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7153,7361,NA,But I ran no farther than the house door for there I ran headforemost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me saying Here you are look sharp come on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7363,7372,NA,Chapter V
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7374,7703,NA,The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butends of their loaded muskets on our doorstep caused the dinnerparty to rise from table in confusion and caused Mrs Joe reentering the kitchen emptyhanded to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of Gracious goodness gracious me whats gonewith thepie
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7705,7831,NA,The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs Joe stood staring at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7833,8018,NA,It was the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand and his left on my shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8020,8227,NA,Excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as I have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadnt I am on a chase in the name of the king and I want the blacksmith
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8229,8331,NA,And pray what might you want with  him  retorted my sister quick to resent his being wanted at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8333,8520,NA,Missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself I should reply the honour and pleasure of his fine wifes acquaintance speaking for the king I answer a little job done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8522,8839,NA,This was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that Mr Pumblechook cried audibly Good again You see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and I find the lock of one of em goes wrong and the coupling dont act pretty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8841,8917,NA,As they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8919,9066,NA,Joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer two hours than one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9068,9076,NA,Will it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9078,9188,NA,Then will you set about it at once blacksmith said the offhand sergeant as its on his Majestys service
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9190,9261,NA,And if my men can bear a hand anywhere theyll make themselves useful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9263,9382,NA,With that he called to his men who came trooping into the kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9384,9623,NA,And then they stood about as soldiers do now with their hands loosely clasped before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now easing a belt or a pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out into the yard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9625,9723,NA,All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them for I was in an agony of apprehension
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9725,9924,NA,But beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background I collected a little more of my scattered wits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9926,10001,NA,Would you give me the time said the sergeant addressing himself to Mr P

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,105,NA,Pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,107,137,NA,Its just gone half past two
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,139,252,NA,Thats not so bad said the sergeant reflecting even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours thatll do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,254,316,NA,How far might you call yourselves from the marshes hereabouts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,318,345,NA,Not above a mile I reckon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,347,375,NA,Just a mile said Mrs Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,377,388,NA,Thatll do

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,584,692,NA,Theyre pretty well known to be out on the marshes still and they wont try to get clear of em before dusk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,694,738,NA,Anybody here seen anything of any such game
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,740,792,NA,Everybody myself excepted said no with confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,794,814,NA,Nobody thought of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,816,924,NA,Well said the sergeant theyll find themselves trapped in a circle I expect sooner than they count on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,926,941,NA,Now blacksmith
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,943,1088,NA,If youre ready his Majesty the King is Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron on and passed into the forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1090,1251,NA,One of the soldiers opened its wooden windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1253,1327,NA,Then Joe began to hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1329,1439,NA,The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention but even made my sister liberal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1441,1550,NA,She drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1552,1606,NA,But Mr Pumblechook said sharply Give him wine Mum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1608,1775,NA,Ill engage theres no tar in that so the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it was equally convenient
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1777,1911,NA,When it was given him he drank his Majestys health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1913,1961,NA,Good stuff eh sergeant said Mr Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1963,2057,NA,Ill tell you something returned the sergeant I suspect that stuffs of  your  providing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2059,2224,NA,Mr Pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said Ay ay Why Because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder youre a man that knows whats what
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2226,2286,NA,Dye think so said Mr Pumblechook with his former laugh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2288,2319,NA,Have another glass With you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2321,2356,NA,Hob and nob returned the sergeant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2358,2494,NA,The top of mine to the foot of yoursthe foot of yours to the top of mineRing once ring twicethe best tune on the Musical Glasses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2496,2507,NA,Your health
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2509,2633,NA,May you live a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2635,2715,NA,The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2717,2925,NA,I noticed that Mr Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the bottle from Mrs Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2927,2942,NA,Even I got some
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2944,3093,NA,And he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the same liberality when the first was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3095,3276,NA,As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge enjoying themselves so much I thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3278,3401,NA,They had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3403,3902,NA,And now when they were all in lively anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them Joe to hammer and clink for them and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the redhot sparks dropped and died the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account poor wretches
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3904,3968,NA,At last Joes job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3970,4103,NA,As Joe got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4105,4234,NA,Mr Pumblechook and Mr Hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society but Mr Wopsle said he would go if Joe would
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4236,4302,NA,Joe said he was agreeable and would take me if Mrs Joe approved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4304,4419,NA,We never should have got leave to go I am sure but for Mrs Joes curiosity to know all about it and how it ended
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4421,4565,NA,As it was she merely stipulated If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket dont look to me to put it together again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4567,4799,NA,The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from Mr Pumblechook as from a comrade though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentlemans merits under arid conditions as when something moist was going
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4801,4842,NA,His men resumed their muskets and fell in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4844,4961,NA,Mr Wopsle Joe and I received strict charge to keep in the rear and to speak no word after we reached the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4963,5112,NA,When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business I treasonably whispered to Joe I hope Joe we shant find them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5114,5189,NA,and Joe whispered to me Id give a shilling if they had cut and run Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5191,5399,NA,We were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming on and the people had good fires indoors and were keeping the day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5401,5478,NA,A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5480,5545,NA,We passed the fingerpost and held straight on to the churchyard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5547,5717,NA,There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeants hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves and also examined the porch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5719,5854,NA,They came in again without finding anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate at the side of the churchyard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5856,5946,NA,A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind and Joe took me on his back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5948,6254,NA,Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding I considered for the first time with great dread if we should come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought the soldiers there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6256,6379,NA,He had asked me if I was a deceiving imp and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6381,6472,NA,Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest and had betrayed him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6474,6522,NA,It was of no use asking myself this question now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6524,6703,NA,There I was on Joes back and there was Joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a hunter and stimulating Mr Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose and to keep up with us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6705,6809,NA,The soldiers were in front of us extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6811,6896,NA,We were taking the course I had begun with and from which I had diverged in the mist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6898,6965,NA,Either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6967,7143,NA,Under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the mound of the Battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain though all of a watery lead colour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7145,7258,NA,With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joes broad shoulder I looked all about for any sign of the convicts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7260,7295,NA,I could see none I could hear none
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7297,7470,NA,Mr Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his blowing and hard breathing but I knew the sounds by this time and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7472,7569,NA,I got a dreadful start when I thought I heard the file still going but it was only a sheepbell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7571,7898,NA,The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7900,8050,NA,The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery and we were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all stopped
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8052,8124,NA,For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a long shout
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8126,8141,NA,It was repeated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8143,8206,NA,It was at a distance towards the east but it was long and loud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8208,8316,NA,Nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised togetherif one might judge from a confusion in the sound
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8318,8422,NA,To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath when Joe and I came up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8424,8536,NA,After another moments listening Joe who was a good judge agreed and Mr Wopsle who was a bad judge agreed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8538,8709,NA,The sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men should make towards it at the double
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8711,8840,NA,So we slanted to the right where the East was and Joe pounded away so wonderfully that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8842,8943,NA,It was a run indeed now and what Joe called in the only two words he spoke all the time a Winder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8945,9072,NA,Down banks and up banks and over gates and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared where he went
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9074,9181,NA,As we came nearer to the shouting it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9183,9253,NA,Sometimes it seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9255,9351,NA,When it broke out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we after them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9353,9466,NA,After a while we had so run it down that we could hear one voice calling Murder and another voice Convicts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9468,9476,NA,Runaways
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9478,9483,NA,Guard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9485,9519,NA,This way for the runaway convicts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9521,9608,NA,Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle and then would break out again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9610,9679,NA,And when it had come to this the soldiers ran like deer and Joe too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9681,9786,NA,The sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two of his men ran in close upon him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9788,9844,NA,Their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9846,9923,NA,Here are both men panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a ditch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9925,9982,NA,Surrender you two and confound you for two wild beasts

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,220,NA,ter was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,222,323,NA,Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but of course I knew them both directly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,325,455,NA,Mind said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers  I  took him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,458,619,NA,I  give him up to you Mind that Its not much to be particular about said the sergeant itll do you small good my man being in the same plight yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,621,675,NA,Handcuffs there I dont expect it to do me any good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,677,767,NA,I dont want it to do me more good than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,769,780,NA,I took him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,782,793,NA,He knows it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,795,816,NA,Thats enough for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,818,955,NA,The other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,957,1104,NA,He could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1106,1171,NA,Take notice guardhe tried to murder me were his first words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1173,1225,NA,Tried to murder him said my convict disdainfully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1227,1246,NA,Try and not do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1248,1295,NA,I took him and giv him up thats what I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1297,1407,NA,I not only prevented him getting off the marshes but I dragged him heredragged him this far on his way back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1409,1454,NA,Hes a gentleman if you please this villain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1456,1510,NA,Now the Hulks has got its gentleman again through me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1512,1522,NA,Murder him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1524,1600,NA,Worth my while too to murder him when I could do worse and drag him back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1602,1661,NA,The other one still gasped He triedhe triedtomurder me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1663,1681,NA,Bearbear witness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1683,1729,NA,Lookee here said my convict to the sergeant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1731,1805,NA,Singlehanded I got clear of the prisonship I made a dash and I done it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1807,1960,NA,I could ha got clear of these deathcold flats likewiselook at my leg you wont find much iron on itif I hadnt made the discovery that  he  was here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1962,1979,NA,Let  him  go free
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1981,2025,NA,Let  him  profit by the means as I found out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2027,2071,NA,Let  him  make a tool of me afresh and again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2073,2082,NA,Once more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2084,2094,NA,No no no
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2096,2292,NA,If I had died at the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands Id have held to him with that grip that you should have been safe to find him in my hold
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2294,2400,NA,The other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion repeated He tried to murder me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2402,2455,NA,I should have been a dead man if you had not come up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2457,2503,NA,He lies said my convict with fierce energy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2505,2544,NA,Hes a liar born and hell die a liar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2546,2586,NA,Look at his face aint it written there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2588,2624,NA,Let him turn those eyes of his on me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2626,2646,NA,I defy him to do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2648,2900,NA,The other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but certainly did not look at the speaker
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2902,2938,NA,Do you see him pursued my convict
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2940,2972,NA,Do you see what a villain he is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2974,3020,NA,Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3022,3070,NA,Thats how he looked when we were tried together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3072,3094,NA,He never looked at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3096,3351,NA,The other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker with the words You are not much to look at and with a halftaunting glance at the bound hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3353,3490,NA,At that point my convict became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3492,3580,NA,Didnt I tell you said the other convict then that he would murder me if he could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3582,3704,NA,And any one could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes like thin snow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3706,3748,NA,Enough of this parley said the sergeant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3750,3771,NA,Light those torches
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3773,3928,NA,As one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time and saw me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3930,4027,NA,I had alighted from Joes back on the brink of the ditch when we came up and had not moved since
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4029,4120,NA,I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4122,4205,NA,I had been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my innocence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4207,4359,NA,It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention for he gave me a look that I did not understand and it all passed in a moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4361,4497,NA,But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having been more attentive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4499,4627,NA,The soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four torches and took one himself and distributed the others
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4629,4720,NA,It had been almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards very dark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4722,4815,NA,Before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in a ring fired twice into the air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4817,4943,NA,Presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4945,4975,NA,All right said the sergeant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4977,4984,NA,March
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4986,5104,NA,We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5106,5193,NA,You are expected on board said the sergeant to my convict they know you are coming
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5195,5217,NA,Dont straggle my man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5219,5233,NA,Close up here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5235,5306,NA,The two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5308,5372,NA,I had hold of Joes hand now and Joe carried one of the torches
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5374,5474,NA,Mr Wopsle had been for going back but Joe was resolved to see it out so we went on with the party
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5476,5654,NA,There was a reasonably good path now mostly on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluicegate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5656,5724,NA,When I looked round I could see the other lights coming in after us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5726,5849,NA,The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and I could see those too lying smoking and flaring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5851,5894,NA,I could see nothing else but black darkness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5896,6054,NA,Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they limped along in the midst of the muskets
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6056,6185,NA,We could not go fast because of their lameness and they were so spent that two or three times we had to halt while they rested
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6187,6276,NA,After an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut and a landingplace
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6278,6354,NA,There was a guard in the hut and they challenged and the sergeant answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6356,6629,NA,Then we went into the hut where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6631,6799,NA,Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their greatcoats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6801,6969,NA,The sergeant made some kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board first
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6971,7018,NA,My convict never looked at me except that once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7020,7227,NA,While we stood in the hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7229,7328,NA,Suddenly he turned to the sergeant and remarked I wish to say something respecting this escape
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7330,7535,NA,It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me You can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7537,7636,NA,Youll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it before its done with you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7638,7690,NA,I know but this is another pint a separate matter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7692,7730,NA,A man cant starve at least  I  cant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7732,7834,NA,I took some wittles up at the willage over yonderwhere the church stands amost out on the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7836,7871,NA,You mean stole said the sergeant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7873,7902,NA,And Ill tell you where from
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7904,7926,NA,From the blacksmiths
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7928,8194,NA,Halloa said the sergeant staring at Joe Halloa Pip said Joe staring at me It was some broken wittlesthats what it wasand a dram of liquor and a pie Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith asked the sergeant confidentially
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8196,8245,NA,My wife did at the very moment when you came in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8247,8405,NA,Dont you know Pip So said my convict turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner and without the least glance at meso youre the blacksmith are you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8407,8563,NA,Than Im sorry to say Ive eat your pie God knows youre welcome to itso far as it was ever mine returned Joe with a saving remembrance of Mrs Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8565,8685,NA,We dont know what you have done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellowcreaturWould
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8687,8695,NA,us Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8697,8795,NA,The something that I had noticed before clicked in the mans throat again and he turned his back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8797,9000,NA,The boat had returned and his guard were ready so we followed him to the landingplace made of rough stakes and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9002,9242,NA,No one seemed surprised to see him or interested in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs Give way you which was the signal for the dip of the oars
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9244,9369,NA,By the light of the torches we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore like a wicked Noahs ark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9371,9497,NA,Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains the prisonship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9499,9575,NA,We saw the boat go alongside and we saw him taken up the side and disappear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9577,9687,NA,Then the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9689,9699,NA,Chapter VI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9701,9885,NA,My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but I hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9887,10001,NA,I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs Joe when the fear of being found out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,3950,3952,person,Joe

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,8521,8523,person,Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,20,NA,t was lifted off me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,22,190,NA,But I loved Joeperhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love himand as to him my inner self was not so easily composed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,192,320,NA,It was much upon my mind particularly when I first saw him looking about for his file that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,322,423,NA,Yet I did not and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did he would think me worse than I was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,425,595,NA,The fear of losing Joes confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my tongue
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,597,771,NA,I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it I never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker without thinking that he was meditating on it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,773,987,NA,That if Joe knew it I never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterdays meat or pudding when it came on todays table without thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,989,1191,NA,That if Joe knew it and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it would bring a rush of blood to my face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1193,1319,NA,In a word I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1321,1441,NA,I had had no intercourse with the world at that time and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1443,1522,NA,Quite an untaught genius I made the discovery of the line of action for myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1524,1635,NA,As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonship Joe took me on his back again and carried me home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1637,1874,NA,He must have had a tiresome journey of it for Mr Wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with Joe and myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1876,2129,NA,In his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital offence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2131,2350,NA,By that time I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2352,2462,NA,As I came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders and the restorative exclamation Yah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2464,2656,NA,Was there ever such a boy as this from my sister I found Joe telling them about the convicts confession and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2658,3034,NA,Mr Pumblechook made out after carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips and as Mr Pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaisecartover everybodyit was agreed that it must be so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3036,3349,NA,Mr Wopsle indeed wildly cried out No with the feeble malice of a tired man but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously set at naughtnot to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not calculated to inspire confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3351,3611,NA,This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me as a slumberous offence to the companys eyesight and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3613,3803,NA,My state of mind as I have described it began before I was up in the morning and lasted long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3805,3816,NA,Chapter VII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3818,3947,NA,At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3949,4278,NA,My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for I read wife of the Above as a complimentary reference to my fathers exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as Below I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4280,4684,NA,Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me at all accurate for I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to walk in the same all the days of my life laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwrights or up by the mill
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4686,4856,NA,When I was old enough I was to be apprenticed to Joe and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs Joe called Pompeyed or as I render it pampered

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2095,2175,NA,And couldnt she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2177,2402,NA,Isnt it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be a tenant of hers and that he may sometimeswe wont say quarterly or halfyearly for that would be requiring too much of youbut sometimesgo there to pay his rent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2404,2488,NA,And couldnt she then ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2490,2859,NA,And couldnt Uncle Pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for usthough you may not think it Joseph in a tone of the deepest reproach as if he were the most callous of nephews then mention this boy standing Prancing herewhich I solemnly declare I was not doingthat I have for ever been a willing slave to Good again cried Uncle Pumblechook

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3190,3508,NA,For you do not know that Uncle Pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell this boys fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havishams has offered to take him into town tonight in his own chaisecart and to keep him tonight and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havishams tomorrow morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3510,3796,NA,And Loramussy me cried my sister casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs with Uncle Pumblechook waiting and the mare catching cold at the door and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3798,4077,NA,With that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps of waterbutts and I was soaped and kneaded and towelled and thumped and harrowed and rasped until I really was quite beside myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4079,4265,NA,I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority with the ridgy effect of a weddingring passing unsympathetically over the human countenance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4267,4447,NA,When my ablutions were completed I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4449,4776,NA,I was then delivered over to Mr Pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all along Boy be forever grateful to all friends but especially unto them which brought you up by hand Goodbye Joe God bless you Pip old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4778,4914,NA,I had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds I could at first see no stars from the chaisecart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4916,5090,NA,But they twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havishams and what on earth I was expected to play at
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5092,5104,NA,Chapter VIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5106,5277,NA,Mr Pumblechooks premises in the High Street of the market town were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5279,5594,NA,It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the tiedup brown paper packets inside whether the flowerseeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5596,5676,NA,It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5678,5886,NA,On the previous night I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5888,5975,NA,In the same early morning I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5977,6252,NA,Mr Pumblechook wore corduroys and so did his shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavour about the corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavour about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that I hardly knew which was which
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6254,6676,NA,The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler who appeared to transact  his  business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6678,6952,NA,The watchmaker always poring over a little desk with a magnifyingglass at his eye and always inspected by a group of smockfrocks poring over him through the glass of his shopwindow seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade engaged his attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6954,7144,NA,Mr Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight oclock in the parlour behind the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7146,7191,NA,I considered Mr Pumblechook wretched company
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7193,7577,NA,Besides being possessed by my sisters idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my dietbesides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogetherhis conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7579,7663,NA,On my politely bidding him Goodmorning he said pompously Seven times nine boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7665,7762,NA,And how should  I  be able to answer dodged in that way in a strange place on an empty stomach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7764,7875,NA,I was hungry but before I had swallowed a morsel he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7877,7942,NA,Seven And four And eight And six And two And ten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7944,7953,NA,And so on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7955,8216,NA,And after each figure was disposed of it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a sup before the next came while he sat at his ease guessing nothing and eating bacon and hot roll in if I may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8218,8420,NA,For such reasons I was very glad when ten oclock came and we started for Miss Havishams though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that ladys roof
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8422,8556,NA,Within a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havishams house which was of old brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8558,8655,NA,Some of the windows had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were rustily barred
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8657,8790,NA,There was a courtyard in front and that was barred so we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come to open it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8792,8880,NA,While we waited at the gate I peeped in even then Mr Pumblechook said And fourteen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8882,8979,NA,but I pretended not to hear him and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8981,9064,NA,No brewing was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9066,9125,NA,A window was raised and a clear voice demanded What name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9127,9171,NA,To which my conductor replied Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9173,9305,NA,The voice returned Quite right and the window was shut again and a young lady came across the courtyard with keys in her hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9307,9367,NA,This said Mr Pumblechook is Pip This is Pip is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9369,9451,NA,returned the young lady who was very pretty and seemed very proud come in Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9453,9523,NA,Mr Pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9525,9539,NA,Oh she said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9541,9576,NA,Did you wish to see Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9578,9652,NA,If Miss Havisham wished to see me returned Mr Pumblechook discomfited
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9654,9698,NA,Ah said the girl but you see she dont
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9700,9839,NA,She said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that Mr Pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not protest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9841,9959,NA,But he eyed me severelyas if  I  had done anything to himand departed with the words reproachfully delivered Boy

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,140,153,NA,But he didnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,155,225,NA,My young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,227,289,NA,It was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,291,504,NA,The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood open away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,506,708,NA,The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,710,883,NA,She saw me looking at it and she said You could drink without hurt all the strong beer thats brewed there now boy I should think I could miss said I in a shy way

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1132,1221,NA,As to strong beer theres enough of it in the cellars already to drown the Manor House
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1223,1348,NA,Illustration Is that the name of this house miss One of its names boy It has more than one then miss One more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1350,1454,NA,Its other name was Satis which is Greek or Latin or Hebrew or all threeor all one to mefor enough
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1456,1509,NA,Enough House said I thats a curious name miss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1511,1562,NA,Yes she replied but it meant more than it said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1564,1644,NA,It meant when it was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1646,1712,NA,They must have been easily satisfied in those days I should think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1714,1736,NA,But dont loiter boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1738,1859,NA,Though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary she was of about my own age
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1861,2026,NA,She seemed much older than I of course being a girl and beautiful and selfpossessed and she was as scornful of me as if she had been oneandtwenty and a queen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2028,2238,NA,We went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two chains across it outsideand the first thing I noticed was that the passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2240,2367,NA,She took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2369,2429,NA,At last we came to the door of a room and she said Go in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2431,2493,NA,I answered more in shyness than politeness After you miss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2495,2562,NA,To this she returned Dont be ridiculous boy I am not going in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2564,2635,NA,And scornfully walked away andwhat was worsetook the candle with her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2637,2687,NA,This was very uncomfortable and I was half afraid
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2689,2796,NA,However the only thing to be done being to knock at the door I knocked and was told from within to enter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2798,2890,NA,I entered therefore and found myself in a pretty large room well lighted with wax candles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2892,2935,NA,No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2937,3059,NA,It was a dressingroom as I supposed from the furniture though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3061,3198,NA,But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded lookingglass and that I made out at first sight to be a fine ladys dressingtable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3200,3309,NA,Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it I cannot say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3311,3456,NA,In an armchair with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the strangest lady I have ever seen or shall ever see
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3458,3534,NA,She was dressed in rich materialssatins and lace and silksall of white
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3536,3556,NA,Her shoes were white
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3558,3675,NA,And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was white
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3677,3783,NA,Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3785,3877,NA,Dresses less splendid than the dress she wore and halfpacked trunks were scattered about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3879,4229,NA,She had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe onthe other was on the table near her handher veil was but half arranged her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and some flowers and a PrayerBook all confusedly heaped about the lookingglass
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4231,4365,NA,It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4367,4506,NA,But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4508,4668,NA,I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4670,4822,NA,I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4824,4952,NA,Once I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4954,5115,NA,Once I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5117,5195,NA,Now waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5197,5232,NA,I should have cried out if I could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5234,5273,NA,Who is it said the lady at the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5275,5287,NA,Pip maam

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5376,5387,NA,Come close
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5389,5623,NA,It was when I stood before her avoiding her eyes that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5625,5657,NA,Look at me said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5659,5737,NA,You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5739,5871,NA,I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer No Do you know what I touch here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5873,5937,NA,she said laying her hands one upon the other on her left side
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5939,5951,NA,Yes maam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5953,5988,NA,It made me think of the young man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5990,6021,NA,What do I touch Your heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6023,6031,NA,Broken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6033,6153,NA,She uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6155,6258,NA,Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they were heavy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6260,6292,NA,I am tired said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6294,6347,NA,I want diversion and I have done with men and women
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6349,6354,NA,Play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6356,6553,NA,I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6555,6654,NA,I sometimes have sick fancies she went on and I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6656,6750,NA,There there with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand play play play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6752,6929,NA,For a moment with the fear of my sisters working me before my eyes I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of Mr Pumblechooks chaisecart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6931,7179,NA,But I felt myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when we had taken a good look at each other Are you sullen and obstinate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7181,7254,NA,No maam I am very sorry for you and very sorry I cant play just now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7256,7415,NA,If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister so I would do it if I could but its so new here and so strange and so fineand melancholy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7417,7520,NA,I stopped fearing I might say too much or had already said it and we took another look at each other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7522,7679,NA,Before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the dress she wore and at the dressingtable and finally at herself in the lookingglass
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7681,7792,NA,So new to him she muttered so old to me so strange to him so familiar to me so melancholy to both of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7794,7807,NA,Call Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7809,7922,NA,As she was still looking at the reflection of herself I thought she was still talking to herself and kept quiet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7924,7993,NA,Call Estella she repeated flashing a look at me You can do that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7995,8007,NA,Call Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8009,8021,NA,At the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8023,8258,NA,To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost as bad as playing to order
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8260,8339,NA,But she answered at last and her light came along the dark passage like a star
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8341,8499,NA,Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8501,8554,NA,Your own one day my dear and you will use it well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8556,8596,NA,Let me see you play cards with this boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8598,8612,NA,With this boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8614,8648,NA,Why he is a common labouringboy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8650,8727,NA,I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answeronly it seemed so unlikelyWell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8729,8753,NA,You can break his heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8755,8830,NA,What do you play boy asked Estella of myself with the greatest disdain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8832,8871,NA,Nothing but beggar my neighbour miss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8873,8916,NA,Beggar him said Miss Havisham to Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8918,8941,NA,So we sat down to cards
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8943,9063,NA,It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9065,9163,NA,I noticed that Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9165,9306,NA,As Estella dealt the cards I glanced at the dressingtable again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never been worn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9308,9452,NA,I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been trodden ragged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9454,9673,NA,Without this arrest of everything this standing still of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like graveclothes or the long veil so like a shroud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9675,9797,NA,So she sat corpselike as we played at cards the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9799,10001,NA,I knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen but I have often thought since that she
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,97,NA,e must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,99,194,NA,He calls the knaves Jacks this boy said Estella with disdain before our first game was out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,196,225,NA,And what coarse hands he has
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,227,248,NA,And what thick boots
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,250,359,NA,I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,361,438,NA,Her contempt for me was so strong that it became infectious and I caught it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,440,469,NA,She won the game and I dealt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,471,613,NA,I misdealt as was only natural when I knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for a stupid clumsy labouringboy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,615,687,NA,You say nothing of her remarked Miss Havisham to me as she looked on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,689,750,NA,She says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,752,813,NA,What do you think of her I dont like to say I stammered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,815,868,NA,Tell me in my ear said Miss Havisham bending down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,870,922,NA,I think she is very proud I replied in a whisper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,924,969,NA,Anything else I think she is very pretty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,971,1019,NA,Anything else I think she is very insulting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1021,1081,NA,She was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1083,1134,NA,Anything else I think I should like to go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1136,1186,NA,And never see her again though she is so pretty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1188,1276,NA,I am not sure that I shouldnt like to see her again but I should like to go home now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1278,1324,NA,You shall go soon said Miss Havisham aloud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1326,1345,NA,Play the game out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1347,1460,NA,Saving for the one weird smile at first I should have felt almost sure that Miss Havishams face could not smile
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1462,1638,NA,It had dropped into a watchful and brooding expressionmost likely when all the things about her had become transfixedand it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1640,1888,NA,Her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul within and without under the weight of a crushing blow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1890,1951,NA,I played the game to an end with Estella and she beggared me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1953,2067,NA,She threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she despised them for having been won of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2069,2123,NA,When shall I have you here again said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2125,2139,NA,Let me think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2141,2285,NA,I was beginning to remind her that today was Wednesday when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2287,2300,NA,There there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2302,2373,NA,I know nothing of days of the week I know nothing of weeks of the year
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2375,2400,NA,Come again after six days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2402,2425,NA,You hear Yes maam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2427,2450,NA,Estella take him down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2452,2532,NA,Let him have something to eat and let him roam and look about him while he eats
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2534,2542,NA,Go Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2544,2656,NA,I followed the candle down as I had followed the candle up and she stood it in the place where we had found it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2658,2774,NA,Until she opened the side entrance I had fancied without thinking about it that it must necessarily be nighttime
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2776,2905,NA,The rush of the daylight quite confounded me and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2907,2989,NA,You are to wait here you boy said Estella and disappeared and closed the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2991,3092,NA,I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3094,3144,NA,My opinion of those accessories was not favourable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3146,3227,NA,They had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3229,3345,NA,I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to call those picturecards Jacks which ought to be called knaves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3347,3437,NA,I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then I should have been so too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3439,3503,NA,She came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3505,3651,NA,She put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3653,3818,NA,I was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorryI cannot hit upon the right name for the smartGod knows what its name wasthat tears started to my eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3820,3925,NA,The moment they sprang there the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3927,4103,NA,This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a contemptuous tossbut with a sense I thought of having made too sure that I was so woundedand left me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4105,4314,NA,But when she was gone I looked about me for a place to hide my face in and got behind one of the gates in the brewerylane and leaned my sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4316,4477,NA,As I cried I kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that needed counteraction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4479,4524,NA,My sisters bringing up had made me sensitive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4526,4679,NA,In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4681,4890,NA,It may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child is small and its world is small and its rockinghorse stands as many hands high according to scale as a bigboned Irish hunter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4892,4977,NA,Within myself I had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with injustice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4979,5098,NA,I had known from the time when I could speak that my sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5100,5211,NA,I had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5213,5482,NA,Through all my punishments disgraces fasts and vigils and other penitential performances I had nursed this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and unprotected way I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5484,5676,NA,I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5678,5795,NA,The bread and meat were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and I was soon in spirits to look about me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5797,6051,NA,To be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeonhouse in the breweryyard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6053,6221,NA,But there were no pigeons in the dovecot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6223,6311,NA,All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6313,6585,NA,In a byyard there was a wilderness of empty casks which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was goneand in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6587,6999,NA,Behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old wall not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked there and that Estella was walking away from me even then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7001,7032,NA,But she seemed to be everywhere
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7034,7181,NA,For when I yielded to the temptation presented by the casks and began to walk on them I saw  her  walking on them at the end of the yard of casks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7183,7330,NA,She had her back towards me and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round and passed out of my view directly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7332,7481,NA,So in the brewery itselfby which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer and where the brewing utensils still were
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7483,7740,NA,When I first went into it and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about me I saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going out into the sky
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7742,7825,NA,It was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened to my fancy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7827,7911,NA,I thought it a strange thing then and I thought it a stranger thing long afterwards
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7913,8108,NA,I turned my eyesa little dimmed by looking up at the frosty lighttowards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8110,8389,NA,A figure all in yellow white with but one shoe to the feet and it hung so that I could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was Miss Havishams with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8391,8553,NA,In the terror of seeing the figure and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before I at first ran from it and then ran towards it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8555,8617,NA,And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8619,8841,NA,Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the courtyard gate and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought me round
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8843,8978,NA,Even with those aids I might not have come to myself as soon as I did but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys to let me out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8980,9108,NA,She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me I thought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9110,9278,NA,She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the gate and stood holding it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9280,9362,NA,I was passing out without looking at her when she touched me with a taunting hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9364,9513,NA,Why dont you cry Because I dont want to You do said she You have been crying till you are half blind and you are near crying again now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9515,9585,NA,She laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9587,9675,NA,I went straight to Mr Pumblechooks and was immensely relieved to find him not at home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9677,10001,NA,So leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at Miss Havishams again I set off on the fourmile walk to our forge pondering as I went along on all I had seen and deeply revolving that I was a common labouringboy that my hands were coarse that my boots were thick that I had fallen into a despicable ha
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,3249,3251,person,Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,3356,3358,person,Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,149,NA,abit of calling knaves Jacks that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night and generally that I was in a lowlived bad way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,151,161,NA,Chapter IX
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,163,277,NA,When I reached home my sister was very curious to know all about Miss Havishams and asked a number of questions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,279,516,NA,And I soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,518,807,NA,If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in minewhich I consider probable as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosityit is the key to many reservations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,809,912,NA,I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havishams as my eyes had seen it I should not be understood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,914,1240,NA,Not only that but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was to say nothing of Miss Estella before the contemplation of Mrs Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1242,1332,NA,Consequently I said as little as I could and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1334,1555,NA,The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard came gaping over in his chaisecart at teatime to have the details divulged to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1557,1745,NA,And the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1747,1844,NA,Well boy Uncle Pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the chair of honour by the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1846,1874,NA,How did you get on up town
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1876,1957,NA,I answered Pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me Pretty well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1959,1983,NA,Mr Pumblechook repeated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1985,2010,NA,Pretty well is no answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2012,2133,NA,Tell us what you mean by pretty well boy Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2135,2215,NA,Anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my obstinacy was adamantine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2217,2317,NA,I reflected for some time and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea I mean pretty well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2319,2510,NA,My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at meI had no shadow of defence for Joe was busy in the forgewhen Mr Pumblechook interposed with No Dont lose your temper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2512,2562,NA,Leave this lad to me maam leave this lad to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2564,2712,NA,Mr Pumblechook then turned me towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said First to get our thoughts in order Fortythree pence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2714,2882,NA,I calculated the consequences of replying Four Hundred Pound and finding them against me went as near the answer as I couldwhich was somewhere about eightpence off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2884,3116,NA,Mr Pumblechook then put me through my pencetable from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had done for me  Now  How much is fortythree pence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3118,3189,NA,To which I replied after a long interval of reflection I dont know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3191,3248,NA,And I was so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3250,3397,NA,Mr Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me and said Is fortythree pence seven and sixpence three fardens for instance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3399,3563,NA,Yes said I And although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and brought him to a dead stop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3565,3569,NA,Boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3571,3598,NA,What like is Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3600,3709,NA,Mr Pumblechook began again when he had recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3711,3743,NA,Very tall and dark I told him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3745,3777,NA,Is she uncle asked my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3779,3909,NA,Mr Pumblechook winked assent from which I at once inferred that he had never seen Miss Havisham for she was nothing of the kind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3911,3951,NA,Good said Mr Pumblechook conceitedly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3953,3982,NA,This is the way to have him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3984,4139,NA,We are beginning to hold our own I think Mum I am sure uncle returned Mrs Joe I wish you had him always you know so well how to deal with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4141,4150,NA,Now boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4152,4223,NA,What was she adoing of when you went in today asked Mr Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4225,4281,NA,She was sitting I answered in a black velvet coach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4283,4522,NA,Mr Pumblechook and Mrs Joe stared at one anotheras they well mightand both repeated In a black velvet coach Yes said I And Miss Estellathats her niece I thinkhanded her in cake and wine at the coachwindow on a gold plate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4524,4567,NA,And we all had cake and wine on gold plates
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4569,4661,NA,And I got up behind the coach to eat mine because she told me to Was anybody else there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4663,4684,NA,asked Mr Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4686,4723,NA,Four dogs said I Large or small
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4725,4801,NA,Immense said I And they fought for vealcutlets out of a silver basket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4803,4879,NA,Mr Pumblechook and Mrs Joe stared at one another again in utter amazement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4881,4977,NA,I was perfectly frantica reckless witness under the tortureand would have told them anything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4979,5028,NA,Where  was  this coach in the name of gracious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5030,5045,NA,asked my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5047,5072,NA,In Miss Havishams room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5074,5091,NA,They stared again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5093,5129,NA,But there werent any horses to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5131,5262,NA,I added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5264,5309,NA,Can this be possible uncle asked Mrs Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5311,5378,NA,What can the boy mean Ill tell you Mum said Mr Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5380,5414,NA,My opinion is its a sedanchair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5416,5510,NA,Shes flighty you knowvery flightyquite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedanchair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5512,5563,NA,Did you ever see her in it uncle asked Mrs Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5565,5650,NA,How could I he returned forced to the admission when I never see her in my life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5652,5698,NA,Never clapped eyes upon her Goodness uncle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5700,5926,NA,And yet you have spoken to her Why dont you know said Mr Pumblechook testily that when I have been there I have been took up to the outside of her door and the door has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5928,5964,NA,Dont say you dont know  that  Mum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5966,6002,NA,Howsever the boy went there to play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6004,6062,NA,What did you play at boy We played with flags I said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6064,6168,NA,I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement when I recall the lies I told on this occasion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6170,6195,NA,Flags echoed my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6197,6357,NA,Yes said I Estella waved a blue flag and I waved a red one and Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out at the coachwindow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6359,6405,NA,And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6407,6435,NA,Swords repeated my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6437,6543,NA,Where did you get swords from Out of a cupboard said I And I saw pistols in itand jamand pills
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6545,6623,NA,And there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up with candles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6625,6683,NA,Thats true Mum said Mr Pumblechook with a grave nod
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6685,6747,NA,Thats the state of the case for that much Ive seen myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6749,6921,NA,And then they both stared at me and I with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6923,7215,NA,If they had asked me any more questions I should undoubtedly have betrayed myself for I was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7217,7343,NA,They were so much occupied however in discussing the marvels I had already presented for their consideration that I escaped
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7345,7424,NA,The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7426,7548,NA,To whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his related my pretended experiences
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7550,7746,NA,Now when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement I was overtaken by penitence but only as regarded himnot in the least as regarded the other two
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7748,7910,NA,Towards Joe and Joe only I considered myself a young monster while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss Havishams acquaintance and favour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7912,8036,NA,They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would do something for me their doubts related to the form that something would take
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8038,8072,NA,My sister stood out for property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8074,8217,NA,Mr Pumblechook was in favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel tradesay the corn and seed trade for instance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8219,8387,NA,Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the vealcutlets
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8389,8527,NA,If a fools head cant express better opinions than that said my sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8529,8539,NA,So he went
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8541,8696,NA,After Mr Pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up I stole into the forge to Joe and remained by him until he had done for the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8698,8779,NA,Then I said Before the fire goes out Joe I should like to tell you something
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8781,8850,NA,Should you Pip said Joe drawing his shoeingstool near the forge

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9085,9211,NA,Its a terrible thing Joe it aint true What are you telling of Pip cried Joe falling back in the greatest amazement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9213,9289,NA,You dont mean to say its Yes I do its lies Joe But not all of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9291,9365,NA,Why sure you dont mean to say Pip that there was no black welwet coeh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9367,9395,NA,For I stood shaking my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9397,9566,NA,But at least there was dogs Pip Come Pip said Joe persuasively if there warnt no wealcutlets at least there was dogs No Joe A dog said Joe A puppy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9568,9622,NA,Come No Joe there was nothing at all of the kind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9624,9691,NA,As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe Joe contemplated me in dismay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9693,9707,NA,Pip old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9709,9734,NA,This wont do old fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9736,9741,NA,I say

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,123,530,NA,And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable and that I hadnt been able to explain myself to Mrs Joe and Pumblechook who were so rude to me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havishams who was dreadfully proud and that she had said I was common and that I knew I was common and that I wished I was not common and that the lies had come of it somehow though I didnt know how
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,532,616,NA,This was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for Joe to deal with as for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,618,716,NA,But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics and by that means vanquished it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,718,822,NA,Theres one thing you may be sure of Pip said Joe after some rumination namely that lies is lies
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,824,936,NA,Howsever they come they didnt ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,938,972,NA,Dont you tell no more of em Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,975,1031,NA,That  aint the way to get out of being common old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1033,1089,NA,And as to being common I dont make it out at all clear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1091,1122,NA,You are oncommon in some things
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1124,1145,NA,Youre oncommon small
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1147,1182,NA,Likewise youre a oncommon scholar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1184,1267,NA,No I am ignorant and backward Joe Why see what a letter you wrote last night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1269,1288,NA,Wrote in print even
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1290,1420,NA,Ive seen lettersAh and from gentlefolksthat Ill swear werent wrote in print said Joe I have learnt next to nothing Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1422,1442,NA,You think much of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1444,1459,NA,Its only that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1461,1585,NA,Well Pip said Joe be it so or be it sont you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one I should hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1587,1880,NA,The king upon his throne with his crown upon his ed cant sit and write his acts of Parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted Prince with the alphabetAh added Joe with a shake of the head that was full of meaning and begun at A too and worked his way to Z
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1882,1955,NA,And  I  know what that is to do though I cant say Ive exactly done it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1957,2029,NA,There was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2031,2342,NA,Whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued Joe reflectively mightnt be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon oneswhich reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps No Joe Im sorry there werent a flag Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2344,2531,NA,Whether that might be or mightnt be is a thing as cant be looked into now without putting your sister on the Rampage and thats a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2533,2590,NA,Lookee here Pip at what is said to you by a true friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2592,2629,NA,Which this to you the true friend say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2631,2734,NA,If you cant get to be oncommon through going straight youll never get to do it through going crooked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2736,2799,NA,So dont tell no more on em Pip and live well and die happy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2801,2848,NA,You are not angry with me Joe No old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2850,3116,NA,But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sortalluding to them which bordered on wealcutlets and dogfightinga sincere wellwisher would adwise Pip their being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3118,3170,NA,Thats all old chap and dont never do it no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3172,3475,NA,When I got up to my little room and said my prayers I did not forget Joes recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state that I thought long after I laid me down how common Estella would consider Joe a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and how coarse his hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3477,3698,NA,I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the level of such common doings
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3700,3940,NA,I fell asleep recalling what I used to do when I was at Miss Havishams as though I had been there weeks or months instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3942,4005,NA,That was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4007,4039,NA,But it is the same with any life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4041,4134,NA,Imagine one selected day struck out of it and think how different its course would have been
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4136,4334,NA,Pause you who read this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4336,4345,NA,Chapter X
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4347,4524,NA,The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4526,4791,NA,In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr Wopsles greataunts at night that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4793,4925,NA,Biddy who was the most obliging of girls immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4927,5042,NA,The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr Wopsles greataunt may be resolved into the following synopsis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5044,5219,NA,The pupils ate apples and put straws down one anothers backs until Mr Wopsles greataunt collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birchrod
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5221,5355,NA,After receiving the charge with every mark of derision the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5357,5468,NA,The book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and a little spellingthat is to say it had had once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5470,5613,NA,As soon as this volume began to circulate Mr Wopsles greataunt fell into a state of coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5615,5785,NA,The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5787,6165,NA,This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6167,6276,NA,This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory students
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6278,6567,NA,When the fights were over Biddy gave out the number of a page and then we all read aloud what we couldor what we couldntin a frightful chorus Biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we were reading about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6569,6722,NA,When this horrible din had lasted a certain time it mechanically awoke Mr Wopsles greataunt who staggered at a boy fortuitously and pulled his ears
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6724,6849,NA,This was understood to terminate the Course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6851,7316,NA,It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupils entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holdenand which was also Mr Wopsles greataunts sittingroom and bedchamberbeing but faintly illuminated through the agency of one lowspirited dipcandle and no snuffers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7318,7797,NA,It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under these circumstances nevertheless I resolved to try it and that very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some information from her little catalogue of Prices under the head of moist sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old English D which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which I supposed until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7799,7907,NA,Of course there was a publichouse in the village and of course Joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7909,8065,NA,I had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen that evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8067,8126,NA,To the Three Jolly Bargemen therefore I directed my steps
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8128,8288,NA,There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to be never paid off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8290,8368,NA,They had been there ever since I could remember and had grown more than I had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8370,8495,NA,But there was a quantity of chalk about our country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8497,8847,NA,It being Saturday night I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records but as my business was with Joe and not with him I merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr Wopsle and a stranger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8849,8977,NA,Joe greeted me as usual with Halloa Pip old chap and the moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8979,9035,NA,He was a secretlooking man whom I had never seen before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9037,9164,NA,His head was all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9166,9302,NA,He had a pipe in his mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time nodded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9304,9410,NA,So I nodded and then he nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit down there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9412,9580,NA,But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of resort I said No thank you sir and fell into the space Joe made for me on the opposite settle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9582,9778,NA,The strange man after glancing at Joe and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again when I had taken my seat and then rubbed his legin a very odd way as it struck me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9780,9863,NA,You was saying said the strange man turning to Joe that you was a blacksmith
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9865,9869,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9871,9927,NA,I said it you know said Joe Whatll you drink Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9929,9970,NA,You didnt mention your name by the bye
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9972,10001,NA,Joe mentioned it now and the

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,211,217,NA,Habit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,219,294,NA,No returned the stranger but once and away and on a Saturday night too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,296,300,NA,Come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,302,332,NA,Put a name to it Mr Gargery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,334,388,NA,I wouldnt wish to be stiff company said Joe Rum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,390,418,NA,Rum repeated the stranger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,420,472,NA,And will the other gentleman originate a sentiment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,474,496,NA,Rum said Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,498,555,NA,Three Rums cried the stranger calling to the landlord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,557,701,NA,Glasses round This other gentleman observed Joe by way of introducing Mr Wopsle is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,703,723,NA,Our clerk at church
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,725,854,NA,Aha said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me The lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,856,877,NA,Thats it said Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,879,993,NA,The stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,995,1141,NA,He wore a flapping broadbrimmed travellers hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1143,1251,NA,As he looked at the fire I thought I saw a cunning expression followed by a halflaugh come into his face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1253,1354,NA,I am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a solitary country towards the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1356,1413,NA,Most marshes is solitary said Joe No doubt no doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1415,1549,NA,Do you find any gypsies now or tramps or vagrants of any sort out there No said Joe none but a runaway convict now and then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1551,1581,NA,And we dont find  them  easy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1583,1598,NA,Eh Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1600,1685,NA,Mr Wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented but not warmly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1687,1743,NA,Seems you have been out after such asked the stranger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1745,1765,NA,Once returned Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1767,1871,NA,Not that we wanted to take them you understand we went out as lookers on me and Mr Wopsle and Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1873,1900,NA,Didnt us Pip Yes Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1902,2074,NA,The stranger looked at me againstill cocking his eye as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gunand said Hes a likely young parcel of bones that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2076,2100,NA,What is it you call him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2102,2533,NA,Pip said Joe Christened Pip No not christened Pip Surname Pip No said Joe its a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant and is called by Son of yours Well said Joe meditatively not of course that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipeswellno
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2535,2548,NA,No he aint
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2550,2579,NA,Nevvy said the strange man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2581,2704,NA,Well said Joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he is notno not to deceive you he is  not my nevvy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2706,2754,NA,What the Blue Blazes is he asked the stranger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2756,2817,NA,Which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2819,3023,NA,Mr Wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry and expounded the ties between me and Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3025,3232,NA,Having his hand in Mr Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added as the poet says
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3234,3387,NA,And here I may remark that when Mr Wopsle referred to me he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3389,3553,NA,I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3555,3744,NA,Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle but some largehanded person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronise me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3746,3892,NA,All this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3894,4070,NA,But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his shot and a most extraordinary shot it was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4072,4164,NA,It was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumbshow and was pointedly addressed to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4166,4259,NA,He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4261,4356,NA,And he stirred it and he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but  with a file 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4358,4476,NA,He did this so that nobody but I saw the file and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breastpocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4478,4573,NA,I knew it to be Joes file and I knew that he knew my convict the moment I saw the instrument
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4575,4607,NA,I sat gazing at him spellbound
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4609,4714,NA,But he now reclined on his settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about turnips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4716,4944,NA,There was a delicious sense of cleaningup and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh in our village on Saturday nights which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4946,5045,NA,The halfhour and the rum and water running out together Joe got up to go and took me by the hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5047,5102,NA,Stop half a moment Mr Gargery said the strange man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5104,5205,NA,I think Ive got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if I have the boy shall have it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5207,5307,NA,He looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some crumpled paper and gave it to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5309,5332,NA,Yours said he Mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5334,5343,NA,Your own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5345,5438,NA,I thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners and holding tight to Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5440,5653,NA,He gave Joe goodnight and he gave Mr Wopsle goodnight who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his aiming eyeno not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5655,5921,NA,On the way home if I had been in a humour for talking the talk must have been all on my side for Mr Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Jolly Bargemen and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5923,6045,NA,But I was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance and could think of nothing else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6047,6219,NA,My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6221,6316,NA,A bad un Ill be bound said Mrs Joe triumphantly or he wouldnt have given it to the boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6318,6335,NA,Lets look at it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6337,6395,NA,I took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6397,6483,NA,But whats this said Mrs Joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6485,6506,NA,Two OnePound notes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6508,6660,NA,Nothing less than two fat sweltering onepound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlemarkets in the county
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6662,6761,NA,Joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6763,6896,NA,While he was gone I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6898,7034,NA,Presently Joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he Joe had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7036,7195,NA,Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under some dried roseleaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7197,7266,NA,There they remained a nightmare to me many and many a night and day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7268,7550,NA,I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convictsa feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7552,7581,NA,I was haunted by the file too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7583,7658,NA,A dread possessed me that when I least expected it the file would reappear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7660,7847,NA,I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havishams next Wednesday and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and I screamed myself awake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7849,7859,NA,Chapter XI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7861,7968,NA,At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havishams and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7970,8094,NA,She locked it after admitting me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8096,8298,NA,She took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously saying You are to come this way today and took me to quite another part of the house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8300,8394,NA,The passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the Manor House
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8396,8521,NA,We traversed but one side of the square however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and opened a door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8523,8759,NA,Here the daylight reappeared and I found myself in a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwellinghouse that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8761,8810,NA,There was a clock in the outer wall of this house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8812,8924,NA,Like the clock in Miss Havishams room and like Miss Havishams watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8926,9042,NA,We went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling on the groundfloor at the back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9044,9177,NA,There was some company in the room and Estella said to me as she joined it You are to go and stand there boy till you are wanted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9179,9292,NA,There being the window I crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind looking out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9294,9640,NA,It opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks and one boxtree that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different colour as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9642,9700,NA,This was my homely thought as I contemplated the boxtree
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9702,9965,NA,There had been some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window as if it pelted me for coming there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9967,10001,NA,I divined that my coming had stoppe

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,77,NA,ed conversation in the room and that its other occupants were looking at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,79,252,NA,I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the windowglass but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,254,307,NA,There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,309,623,NA,Before I had been standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,625,777,NA,They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebodys pleasure and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,779,963,NA,This lady whose name was Camilla very much reminded me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as I found when I caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,965,1109,NA,Indeed when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1111,1191,NA,Poor dear soul said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my sisters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1193,1326,NA,Nobodys enemy but his own It would be much more commendable to be somebody elses enemy said the gentleman far more natural
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1328,1399,NA,Cousin Raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1401,1566,NA,Sarah Pocket returned Cousin Raymond if a man is not his own neighbour who is Miss Pocket laughed and Camilla laughed and said checking a yawn The idea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1568,1628,NA,But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1630,1836,NA,The other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and emphatically  Very  true Poor soul Camilla presently went on I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time he is so very strange
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1838,2008,NA,Would anyone believe that when Toms wife died he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the childrens having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2010,2118,NA,Good Lord says he Camilla what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2120,2135,NA,So like Matthew
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2137,2331,NA,The idea Good points in him good points in him said Cousin Raymond Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him but he never had and he never will have any sense of the proprieties
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2333,2398,NA,You know I was obliged said CamillaI was obliged to be firm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2400,2454,NA,I said It WILL NOT DO for the credit of the family
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2456,2521,NA,I told him that without deep trimmings the family was disgraced
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2523,2566,NA,I cried about it from breakfast till dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2568,2590,NA,I injured my digestion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2592,2807,NA,And at last he flung out in his violent way and said with a D Then do as you like Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2809,2856,NA, He  paid for them did he not asked Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2858,2933,NA,Its not the question my dear child who paid for them returned Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2935,2951,NA, I  bought them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2953,3025,NA,And I shall often think of that with peace when I wake up in the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3027,3347,NA,The ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which I had come interrupted the conversation and caused Estella to say to me Now boy On my turning round they all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as I went out I heard Sarah Pocket say Well I am sure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3349,3424,NA,What next and Camilla add with indignation Was there ever such a fancy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3426,3635,NA,The id e a As we were going with our candle along the dark passage Estella stopped all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with her face quite close to mine Well Well miss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3637,3692,NA,I answered almost falling over her and checking myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3694,3772,NA,She stood looking at me and of course I stood looking at her Am I pretty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3774,3808,NA,Yes I think you are very pretty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3810,3826,NA,Am I insulting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3828,3898,NA,Not so much so as you were last time said I Not so much so No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3900,4014,NA,She fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with such force as she had when I answered it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4016,4113,NA,Now said she You little coarse monster what do you think of me now I shall not tell you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4115,4154,NA,Because you are going to tell upstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4156,4167,NA,Is that it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4169,4198,NA,No said I thats not it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4200,4244,NA,Why dont you cry again you little wretch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4246,4454,NA,Because Ill never cry for you again said I Which was I suppose as false a declaration as ever was made for I was inwardly crying for her then and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4456,4569,NA,We went on our way upstairs after this episode and as we were going up we met a gentleman groping his way down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4571,4590,NA,Whom have we here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4592,4662,NA,asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me A boy said Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4664,4780,NA,He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4782,4885,NA,He took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4887,5009,NA,He was prematurely bald on the top of his head and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5011,5094,NA,His eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5096,5209,NA,He had a large watchchain and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5211,5376,NA,He was nothing to me and I could have had no foresight then that he ever would be anything to me but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5378,5403,NA,Boy of the neighbourhood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5405,5464,NA,Hey said he Yes sir said I How do  you  come here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5466,5511,NA,Miss Havisham sent for me sir I explained
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5513,5518,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5520,5535,NA,Behave yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5537,5610,NA,I have a pretty large experience of boys and youre a bad set of fellows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5612,5714,NA,Now mind said he biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5716,5832,NA,With those words he released mewhich I was glad of for his hand smelt of scented soapand went his way downstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5834,5972,NA,I wondered whether he could be a doctor but no I thought he couldnt be a doctor or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5974,6123,NA,There was not much time to consider the subject for we were soon in Miss Havishams room where she and everything else were just as I had left them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6125,6248,NA,Estella left me standing near the door and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her eyes upon me from the dressingtable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6250,6339,NA,So she said without being startled or surprised the days have worn away have they
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6341,6352,NA,Yes maam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6354,6431,NA,Today is There there there with the impatient movement of her fingers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6433,6454,NA,I dont want to know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6456,6478,NA,Are you ready to play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6480,6550,NA,I was obliged to answer in some confusion I dont think I am maam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6552,6609,NA,Not at cards again she demanded with a searching look
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6611,6657,NA,Yes maam I could do that if I was wanted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6659,6799,NA,Since this house strikes you old and grave boy said Miss Havisham impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6801,6932,NA,I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question and I said I was quite willing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6934,7062,NA,Then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand and wait there till I come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7064,7131,NA,I crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7133,7239,NA,From that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an airless smell that was oppressive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7241,7463,NA,A fire had been lately kindled in the damp oldfashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer airlike our own marsh mist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7465,7623,NA,Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the chamber or it would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7625,7770,NA,It was spacious and I dare say had once been handsome but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7772,7935,NA,The most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7937,8397,NA,An epergne or centrepiece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable and as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow like a black fungus I saw specklelegged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8399,8508,NA,I heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same occurrence were important to their interests
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8510,8705,NA,But the black beetles took no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way as if they were shortsighted and hard of hearing and not on terms with one another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8707,8846,NA,These crawling things had fascinated my attention and I was watching them from a distance when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8848,8959,NA,In her other hand she had a crutchheaded stick on which she leaned and she looked like the Witch of the place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8961,9061,NA,This said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where I will be laid when I am dead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9063,9099,NA,They shall come and look at me here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9101,9278,NA,With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair I shrank under her touch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9280,9420,NA,What do you think that is she asked me again pointing with her stick that where those cobwebs are I cant guess what it is maam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9422,9440,NA,Its a great cake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9442,9454,NA,A bridecake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9456,9461,NA,Mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9463,9597,NA,She looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder Come come come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9599,9616,NA,Walk me walk me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9618,9717,NA,I made out from this that the work I had to do was to walk Miss Havisham round and round the room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9719,9923,NA,Accordingly I started at once and she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of Mr Pumblechooks chaisecart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9925,9994,NA,She was not physically strong and after a little time said Slower
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9996,10001,NA,Still

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,9684,9691,person,Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,195,NA, we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,197,325,NA,After a while she said Call Estella so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,327,431,NA,When her light appeared I returned to Miss Havisham and we started away again round and round the room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,433,652,NA,If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings I should have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below I didnt know what to do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,654,837,NA,In my politeness I would have stopped but Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted onwith a shamefaced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,839,883,NA,Dear Miss Havisham said Miss Sarah Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,885,940,NA,How well you look I do not returned Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,942,969,NA,I am yellow skin and bone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,971,1109,NA,Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff and she murmured as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham Poor dear soul
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1111,1164,NA,Certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1166,1227,NA,The idea And how are  you  said Miss Havisham to Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1229,1339,NA,As we were close to Camilla then I would have stopped as a matter of course only Miss Havisham wouldnt stop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1341,1403,NA,We swept on and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1405,1480,NA,Thank you Miss Havisham she returned I am as well as can be expected
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1482,1562,NA,Why whats the matter with you asked Miss Havisham with exceeding sharpness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1564,1607,NA,Nothing worth mentioning replied Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1609,1787,NA,I dont wish to make a display of my feelings but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to Then dont think of me retorted Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1789,1916,NA,Very easily said remarked Camilla amiably repressing a sob while a hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1918,2002,NA,Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2004,2064,NA,Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2066,2169,NA,Chokings and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2171,2276,NA,If I could be less affectionate and sensitive I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2278,2309,NA,I am sure I wish it could be so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2311,2387,NA,But as to not thinking of you in the nightThe idea Here a burst of tears
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2389,2494,NA,The Raymond referred to I understood to be the gentleman present and him I understood to be Mr Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2496,2740,NA,He came to the rescue at this point and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice Camilla my dear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2742,2898,NA,I am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person my dear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2900,3153,NA,Miss Sarah Pocket whom I now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnutshells and a large mouth like a cats without the whiskers supported this position by saying No indeed my dear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3155,3207,NA,Hem Thinking is easy enough said the grave lady
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3209,3263,NA,What is easier you know assented Miss Sarah Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3265,3365,NA,Oh yes yes cried Camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3367,3386,NA,Its all very true
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3388,3446,NA,Its a weakness to be so affectionate but I cant help it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3448,3558,NA,No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise still I wouldnt change my disposition if I could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3560,3666,NA,Its the cause of much suffering but its a consolation to know I posses it when I wake up in the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3668,3697,NA,Here another burst of feeling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3699,3896,NA,Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time but kept going round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3898,3929,NA,Theres Matthew said Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3931,4013,NA,Never mixing with any natural ties never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4015,4240,NA,I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head over the side and my hair all down and my feet I dont know where Much higher than your head my love said Mr Camilla
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4242,4444,NA,I have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of Matthews strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me Really I must say I should think not interposed the grave lady
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4446,5134,NA,You see my dear added Miss Sarah Pocket a blandly vicious personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to thank you my love Without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed Camilla I have remained in that state hours and hours and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been and I have been heard at the pianoforte tuners across the street where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distanceand now to be told Here Camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5136,5244,NA,When this same Matthew was mentioned Miss Havisham stopped me and herself and stood looking at the speaker
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5246,5327,NA,This change had a great influence in bringing Camillas chemistry to a sudden end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5329,5427,NA,Matthew will come and see me at last said Miss Havisham sternly when I am laid on that table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5429,5507,NA,That will be his placethere striking the table with her stick at my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5509,5532,NA,And yours will be there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5534,5558,NA,And your husbands there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5560,5584,NA,And Sarah Pockets there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5586,5607,NA,And Georgianas there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5609,5684,NA,Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5686,5697,NA,And now go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5699,5782,NA,At the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in a new place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5784,5838,NA,She now said Walk me walk me and we went on again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5840,5921,NA,I suppose theres nothing to be done exclaimed Camilla but comply and depart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5923,6009,NA,Its something to have seen the object of ones love and duty for even so short a time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6011,6089,NA,I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6091,6157,NA,I wish Matthew could have that comfort but he sets it at defiance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6159,6325,NA,I am determined not to make a display of my feelings but its very hard to be told one wants to feast on ones relationsas if one was a Giantand to be told to go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6327,6341,NA,The bare idea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6343,6616,NA,Mr Camilla interposing as Mrs Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham was escorted forth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6618,6823,NA,Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6825,7017,NA,Sarah Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with Bless you Miss Havisham dear and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnutshell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7019,7143,NA,While Estella was away lighting them down Miss Havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7145,7267,NA,At last she stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it some seconds This is my birthday Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7269,7338,NA,I was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7340,7374,NA,I dont suffer it to be spoken of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7376,7446,NA,I dont suffer those who were here just now or any one to speak of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7448,7505,NA,They come here on the day but they dare not refer to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7507,7558,NA,Of course  I  made no further effort to refer to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7560,7742,NA,On this day of the year long before you were born this heap of decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it was brought here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7744,7776,NA,It and I have worn away together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7778,7861,NA,The mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7863,8100,NA,She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state to crumble under a touch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8102,8345,NA,When the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when they lay me dead in my brides dress on the brides tablewhich shall be done and which will be the finished curse upon himso much the better if it is done on this day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8347,8431,NA,She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8433,8449,NA,I remained quiet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8451,8495,NA,Estella returned and she too remained quiet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8497,8551,NA,It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8553,8721,NA,In the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might presently begin to decay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8723,8879,NA,At length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an instant Miss Havisham said Let me see you two play cards why have you not begun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8881,9152,NA,With that we returned to her room and sat down as before I was beggared as before and again as before Miss Havisham watched us all the time directed my attention to Estellas beauty and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estellas breast and hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9154,9251,NA,Estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she did not condescend to speak
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9253,9404,NA,When we had played some halfdozen games a day was appointed for my return and I was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former doglike manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9406,9461,NA,There too I was again left to wander about as I liked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9463,9627,NA,It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last occasion open or shut
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9629,9683,NA,Enough that I saw no gate then and that I saw one now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9685,9856,NA,As it stood open and as I knew that Estella had let the visitors outfor she had returned with the keys in her handI strolled into the garden and strolled all over it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9858,10001,NA,It was quite a wilderness and there were old melonframes and cucumberframes in it which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneo

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,137,NA,ous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,139,331,NA,When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallendown grapevine and some bottles I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,333,549,NA,Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty I looked in at another window and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,551,622,NA,This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,624,719,NA,He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him and I now saw that he was inky
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,721,754,NA,Halloa said he young fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,756,869,NA,Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself  I  said Halloa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,871,901,NA,politely omitting young fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,903,946,NA,Who let  you  in said he Miss Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,948,999,NA,Who gave you leave to prowl about Miss Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1001,1048,NA,Come and fight said the pale young gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1050,1080,NA,What could I do but follow him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1082,1152,NA,I have often asked myself the question since but what else could I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1154,1264,NA,His manner was so final and I was so astonished that I followed where he led as if I had been under a spell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1266,1344,NA,Stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many paces
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1346,1393,NA,I ought to give you a reason for fighting too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1395,1407,NA,There it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1409,1622,NA,In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1624,1797,NA,The bulllike proceeding last mentioned besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1799,1876,NA,I therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again when he said Aha
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1878,1990,NA,Would you and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1992,2019,NA,Laws of the game said he
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2021,2071,NA,Here he skipped from his left leg on to his right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2073,2088,NA,Regular rules
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2090,2140,NA,Here he skipped from his right leg on to his left
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2142,2298,NA,Come to the ground and go through the preliminaries Here he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while I looked helplessly at him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2300,2564,NA,I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous but I felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach and that I had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2566,2705,NA,Therefore I followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2707,2909,NA,On his asking me if I was satisfied with the ground and on my replying Yes he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2911,2972,NA,Available for both he said placing these against the wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2974,3124,NA,And then fell to pulling off not only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once lighthearted businesslike and bloodthirsty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3126,3271,NA,Although he did not look very healthyhaving pimples on his face and a breaking out at his mouththese dreadful preparations quite appalled me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3273,3404,NA,I judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3406,3593,NA,For the rest he was a young gentleman in a grey suit when not denuded for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3595,3753,NA,My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3755,3944,NA,I never have been so surprised in my life as I was when I let out the first blow and saw him lying on his back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly foreshortened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3946,4058,NA,But he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4060,4185,NA,The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again looking up at me out of a black eye
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4187,4228,NA,His spirit inspired me with great respect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4230,4591,NA,He seemed to have no strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out of the waterbottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4593,4805,NA,He got heavily bruised for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him the harder I hit him but he came up again and again and again until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4807,5048,NA,Even after that crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times not knowing where I was but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out That means you have won
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5050,5175,NA,He seemed so brave and innocent that although I had not proposed the contest I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5177,5299,NA,Indeed I go so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5301,5484,NA,However I got dressed darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and I said Can I help you and he said No thankee and I said Good afternoon and  he  said Same to you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5486,5554,NA,When I got into the courtyard I found Estella waiting with the keys
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5556,5722,NA,But she neither asked me where I had been nor why I had kept her waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something had happened to delight her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5724,5818,NA,Instead of going straight to the gate too she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5820,5830,NA,Come here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5832,5861,NA,You may kiss me if you like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5863,5904,NA,I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5906,5970,NA,I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5972,6098,NA,But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and that it was worth nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6100,6395,NA,What with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with the fight my stay had lasted so long that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black nightsky and Joes furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6397,6408,NA,Chapter XII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6410,6477,NA,My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6479,6681,NA,The more I thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6683,6776,NA,I felt that the pale young gentlemans blood was on my head and that the Law would avenge it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6778,7057,NA,Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of England without laying themselves open to severe punishment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7059,7263,NA,For some days I even kept close at home and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7265,7392,NA,The pale young gentlemans nose had stained my trousers and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7394,7627,NA,I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentlemans teeth and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7629,7736,NA,When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence my terrors reached their height
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7738,8456,NA,Whether myrmidons of Justice especially sent down from London would be lying in ambush behind the gatewhether Miss Havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house might rise in those graveclothes of hers draw a pistol and shoot me deadwhether suborned boysa numerous band of mercenariesmight be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery and cuff me until I was no moreit was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that I never imagined  him  accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8458,8509,NA,However go to Miss Havishams I must and go I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8511,8521,NA,And behold
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8523,8556,NA,nothing came of the late struggle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8558,8656,NA,It was not alluded to in any way and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8658,8854,NA,I found the same gate open and I explored the garden and even looked in at the windows of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within and all was lifeless
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8856,8970,NA,Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentlemans existence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8972,9072,NA,There were traces of his gore in that spot and I covered them with gardenmould from the eye of man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9074,9260,NA,On the broad landing between Miss Havishams own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out I saw a gardenchaira light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9262,9532,NA,It had been placed there since my last visit and I entered that same day on a regular occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across the landing and round the other room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9534,9659,NA,Over and over and over again we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9661,9910,NA,I insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9912,10001,NA,As we began to be more used to one another Miss Havisham talked more to me and asked me

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,6997,7003,location,England
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,7794,7799,location,London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,64,NA,such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,66,267,NA,I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe I believed and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,269,341,NA,But she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer my being ignorant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,343,472,NA,Neither did she ever give me any moneyor anything but my daily dinnernor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,474,570,NA,Estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told me I might kiss her again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,572,760,NA,Sometimes she would coldly tolerate me sometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite familiar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she hated me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,762,874,NA,Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were alone Does she grow prettier and prettier Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,876,949,NA,And when I said yes for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,951,1070,NA,Also when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on with a miserly relish of Estellas moods whatever they were
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1072,1368,NA,And sometimes when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness murmuring something in her ear that sounded like Break their hearts my pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1370,1462,NA,There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the burden was Old Clem
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1464,1599,NA,This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation towards smiths
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1601,1742,NA,It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clems respected name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1744,1788,NA,Thus you were to hammer boys roundOld Clem
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1790,1858,NA,With a thump and a soundOld Clem Beat it out beat it outOld Clem
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1860,1974,NA,With a clink for the stoutOld Clem Blow the fire blow the fireOld Clem Roaring dryer soaring higherOld Clem
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1976,2125,NA,One day soon after the appearance of the chair Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me with the impatient movement of her fingers There there there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2127,2132,NA,Sing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2134,2205,NA,I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2207,2320,NA,It happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2322,2577,NA,After that it became customary with us to have it as we moved about and Estella would often join in though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2579,2622,NA,What could I become with these surroundings
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2624,2676,NA,How could my character fail to be influenced by them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2678,2812,NA,Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed as my eyes were when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2814,2969,NA,Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman if I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had confessed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2971,3166,NA,Under the circumstances I felt that Joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach therefore I said nothing of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3168,3319,NA,Besides that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time went on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3321,3404,NA,I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy but I told poor Biddy everything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3406,3547,NA,Why it came natural to me to do so and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her I did not know then though I think I know now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3549,3671,NA,Meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3673,3966,NA,That ass Pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister and I really do believe to this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaisecart they would have done it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3968,4338,NA,The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before himas it were to operate uponand he would drag me up from my stool usually by the collar where I was quiet in a corner and putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked would begin by saying Now Mum here is this boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4340,4385,NA,Here is this boy which you brought up by hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4387,4460,NA,Hold up your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4462,4501,NA,Now Mum with respections to this boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4503,4771,NA,And then he would rumple my hair the wrong waywhich from my earliest remembrance as already hinted I have in my soul denied the right of any fellowcreature to doand would hold me before him by the sleevea spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4773,5022,NA,Then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about Miss Havisham and about what she would do with me and for me that I used to wantquite painfullyto burst into spiteful tears fly at Pumblechook and pummel him all over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5024,5334,NA,In these dialogues my sister spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference while Pumblechook himself selfconstituted my patron would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5336,5374,NA,In these discussions Joe bore no part
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5376,5527,NA,But he was often talked at while they were in progress by reason of Mrs Joes perceiving that he was not favourable to my being taken from the forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5529,5861,NA,I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to Joe and when Joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his hands shake him and put it away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5863,5924,NA,There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5926,6095,NA,All in a moment with nothing to lead up to it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as it were incidentally would swoop upon me with Come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6097,6120,NA,theres enough of  you 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6123,6198,NA,You  get along to bed  you ve given trouble enough for one night I hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6200,6259,NA,As if I had besought them as a favour to bother my life out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6261,6684,NA,We went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day Miss Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking she leaning on my shoulder and said with some displeasure You are growing tall Pip I thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6686,6828,NA,She said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me again and presently again and after that looked frowning and moody
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6830,7051,NA,On the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and I had landed her at her dressingtable she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7053,7073,NA,Joe Gargery maam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7075,7147,NA,Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to Yes Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7149,7187,NA,You had better be apprenticed at once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7189,7263,NA,Would Gargery come here with you and bring your indentures do you think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7265,7338,NA,I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7340,7359,NA,Then let him come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7361,7400,NA,At any particular time Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7402,7415,NA,There there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7417,7443,NA,I know nothing about times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7445,7488,NA,Let him come soon and come along with you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7490,7638,NA,When I got home at night and delivered this message for Joe my sister went on the Rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous period
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7640,7803,NA,She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was doormats under our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously thought she  was  fit for
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7805,8038,NA,When she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries she threw a candlestick at Joe burst into a loud sobbing got out the dustpanwhich was always a very bad signput on her coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8040,8196,NA,Not satisfied with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbingbrush and cleaned us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the backyard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8198,8493,NA,It was ten oclock at night before we ventured to creep in again and then she asked Joe why he hadnt married a Negress Slave at once Joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8495,8507,NA,Chapter XIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8509,8649,NA,It was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see Joe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havishams
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8651,9043,NA,However as he thought his courtsuit necessary to the occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his workingdress the rather because I knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled up his shirtcollar so very high behind that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9045,9293,NA,At breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town with us and being left at Uncle Pumblechooks and called for when we had done with our fine ladiesa way of putting the case from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9295,9561,NA,The forge was shut up for the day and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable HOUT accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9563,9792,NA,We walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited Straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it was a fine bright day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9794,10001,NA,I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously but I rather think they were displayed as articles of propertymuch as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the R

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,60,NA,Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,62,125,NA,When we came to Pumblechooks my sister bounced in and left us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,127,201,NA,As it was almost noon Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havishams house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,203,435,NA,Estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,437,515,NA,Estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that I knew so well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,517,558,NA,I followed next to her and Joe came last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,560,724,NA,When I looked back at Joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,726,843,NA,Estella told me we were both to go in so I took Joe by the coatcuff and conducted him into Miss Havishams presence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,845,917,NA,She was seated at her dressingtable and looked round at us immediately
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,919,989,NA,Oh said she to Joe You are the husband of the sister of this boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,991,1202,NA,I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with his tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1204,1278,NA,You are the husband repeated Miss Havisham of the sister of this boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1280,1391,NA,It was very aggravating but throughout the interview Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1393,1666,NA,Which I meantersay Pip Joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great politeness as I hup and married your sister and I were at the time what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1668,1694,NA,Well said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1696,1948,NA,And you have reared the boy with the intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so Mr Gargery You know Pip replied Joe as you and me were ever friends and it were looked forard to betwixt us as being calclated to lead to larks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1950,2195,NA,Not but what Pip if you had ever made objections to the businesssuch as its being open to black and sut or suchlikenot but what they would have been attended to dont you see Has the boy said Miss Havisham ever made any objection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2197,2220,NA,Does he like the trade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2222,2400,NA,Which it is well beknown to yourself Pip returned Joe strengthening his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that it were the wish of your own hart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2402,2607,NA,I saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on to say And there werent no objection on your part and Pip it were the great wish of your hart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2609,2710,NA,It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he ought to speak to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2712,2906,NA,The more I made faces and gestures to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he persisted in being to Me Have you brought his indentures with you asked Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2908,3063,NA,Well Pip you know replied Joe as if that were a little unreasonable you yourself see me put em in my at and therefore you know as they are here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3065,3140,NA,With which he took them out and gave them not to Miss Havisham but to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3142,3331,NA,I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellowI  know  I was ashamed of himwhen I saw that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havishams chair and that her eyes laughed mischievously
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3333,3401,NA,I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3403,3496,NA,You expected said Miss Havisham as she looked them over no premium with the boy Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3498,3541,NA,I remonstrated for he made no reply at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3543,3762,NA,Why dont you answer Pip returned Joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me and which you know the answer to be full well No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3764,3821,NA,You know it to be No Pip and wherefore should I say it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3823,4004,NA,Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than I had thought possible seeing what he was there and took up a little bag from the table beside her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4006,4064,NA,Pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4066,4111,NA,There are fiveandtwenty guineas in this bag
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4113,4141,NA,Give it to your master Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4143,4310,NA,As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room Joe even at this pass persisted in addressing me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4312,4465,NA,This is wery liberal on your part Pip said Joe and it is as such received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near nor nowheres
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4467,4676,NA,And now old chap said Joe conveying to me a sensation first of burning and then of freezing for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havishamand now old chap may we do our duty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4678,4998,NA,May you and me do our duty both on us by one and another and by them which your liberal presenthaveconweyedto befor the satisfaction of mindofthem as never here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words and from myself far be it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5000,5081,NA,These words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5083,5118,NA,Goodbye Pip said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5120,5143,NA,Let them out Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5145,5180,NA,Am I to come again Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5182,5189,NA,I asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5191,5194,NA,No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5196,5222,NA,Gargery is your master now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5224,5231,NA,Gargery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5233,5403,NA,One word Thus calling him back as I went out of the door I heard her say to Joe in a distinct emphatic voice The boy has been a good boy here and that is his reward
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5405,5471,NA,Of course as an honest man you will expect no other and no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5473,5712,NA,How Joe got out of the room I have never been able to determine but I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him and laid hold of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5714,5797,NA,In another minute we were outside the gate and it was locked and Estella was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5799,5901,NA,When we stood in the daylight alone again Joe backed up against a wall and said to me Astonishing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5903,6034,NA,And there he remained so long saying Astonishing at intervals so often that I began to think his senses were never coming back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6036,6186,NA,At length he prolonged his remark into Pip I do assure  you  this is asTONishing and so by degrees became conversational and able to walk away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6188,6364,NA,I have reason to think that Joes intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through and that on our way to Pumblechooks he invented a subtle and deep design
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6366,6531,NA,My reason is to be found in what took place in Mr Pumblechooks parlour where on our presenting ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6533,6584,NA,Well cried my sister addressing us both at once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6586,6615,NA,And whats happened to  you 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6617,6894,NA,I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this I am sure I do Miss Havisham said Joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of remembrance made it wery partickler that we should give herwere it compliments or respects Pip Compliments I said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6896,7052,NA,Which that were my own belief answered Joe her compliments to Mrs J Gargery Much good theyll do me observed my sister but rather gratified too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7054,7275,NA,And wishing pursued Joe with another fixed look at me like another effort of remembrance that the state of Miss Havishams elth were sitch as would haveallowed were it Pip Of her having the pleasure I added
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7277,7307,NA,Of ladies company said Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7309,7331,NA,And drew a long breath
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7333,7400,NA,Well cried my sister with a mollified glance at Mr Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7402,7499,NA,She might have had the politeness to send that message at first but its better late than never
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7501,7544,NA,And what did she give young Rantipole here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7546,7581,NA,She giv him said Joe nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7583,7631,NA,Mrs Joe was going to break out but Joe went on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7633,7684,NA,What she giv said Joe she giv to his friends
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7686,7810,NA,And by his friends were her explanation I mean into the hands of his sister Mrs J Gargery Them were her words Mrs

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7825,7926,NA,She maynt have knowd added Joe with an appearance of reflection whether it were Joe or Jorge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7928,8087,NA,My sister looked at Pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden armchair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all about it beforehand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8089,8143,NA,And how much have you got asked my sister laughing

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8227,8281,NA,Theyd say returned my sister curtly pretty well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8283,8313,NA,Not too much but pretty well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8315,8352,NA,Its more than that then said Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8354,8529,NA,That fearful Impostor Pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he rubbed the arms of his chair Its more than that Mum Why you dont mean to say began my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8531,8581,NA,Yes I do Mum said Pumblechook but wait a bit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8583,8596,NA,Go on Joseph

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8737,8790,NA,Well then said Joe Its more than twenty pound
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8792,8903,NA,That abject hypocrite Pumblechook nodded again and said with a patronizing laugh Its more than that Mum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8905,8915,NA,Good again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8917,9050,NA,Follow her up Joseph Then to make an end of it said Joe delightedly handing the bag to my sister its fiveandtwenty pound
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9052,9271,NA,Its fiveandtwenty pound Mum echoed that basest of swindlers Pumblechook rising to shake hands with her and its no more than your merits as I said when my opinion was asked and I wish you joy of the money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9273,9490,NA,If the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9492,9654,NA,Now you see Joseph and wife said Pumblechook as he took me by the arm above the elbow I am one of them that always go right through with what theyve begun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9656,9691,NA,This boy must be bound out of hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9693,9708,NA,Thats  my  way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9710,9728,NA,Bound out of hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9730,9895,NA,Goodness knows Uncle Pumblechook said my sister grasping the money were deeply beholden to you Never mind me Mum returned that diabolical cornchandler
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9897,9940,NA,A pleasures a pleasure all the world over

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,33,NA,see to itto tell you the truth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,35,179,NA,The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,181,548,NA,I say we went over but I was pushed over by Pumblechook exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken redhanded for as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd I heard some people say Whats he done and others Hes a young un too but looks bad dont he
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,550,748,NA,One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausageshop of fetters and entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,750,1180,NA,The Hall was a queer place I thought with higher pews in it than a churchand with people hanging over the pews looking onand with mighty Justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading the newspapersand with some shining black portraits on the walls which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and stickingplaster
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1182,1402,NA,Here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested and I was bound Mr Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little preliminaries disposed of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1404,1662,NA,When we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me we went back to Pumblechooks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1664,1914,NA,And there my sister became so excited by the twentyfive guineas that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaisecart and bring the Hubbles and Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1916,1976,NA,It was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day I passed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1978,2108,NA,For it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole company that I was an excrescence on the entertainment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2110,2242,NA,And to make it worse they all asked me from time to timein short whenever they had nothing else to dowhy I didnt enjoy myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2244,2325,NA,And what could I possibly do then but say I  was  enjoying myselfwhen I wasnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2327,2406,NA,However they were grown up and had their own way and they made the most of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2408,2922,NA,That swindling Pumblechook exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2924,3094,NA,My only other remembrances of the great festival are That they wouldnt let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up and told me to enjoy myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3096,3351,NA,That rather late in the evening Mr Wopsle gave us Collinss ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down with such effect that a waiter came in and said The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments and it wasnt the Tumblers Arms
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3353,3433,NA,That they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang O Lady Fair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3435,3770,NA,Mr Wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about everybodys private affairs that  he  was the man with his white locks flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3772,3924,NA,Finally I remember that when I got into my little bedroom I was truly wretched and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joes trade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3926,3967,NA,I had liked it once but once was not now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3969,3980,NA,Chapter XIV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3982,4034,NA,It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4036,4185,NA,There may be black ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved but that it is a miserable thing I can testify
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4187,4265,NA,Home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sisters temper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4267,4319,NA,But Joe had sanctified it and I had believed in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4321,4680,NA,I had believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon I had believed in the front door as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4682,4723,NA,Within a single year all this was changed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4725,4831,NA,Now it was all coarse and common and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4833,4992,NA,How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault how much Miss Havishams how much my sisters is now of no moment to me or to any one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4994,5039,NA,The change was made in me the thing was done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5041,5096,NA,Well or ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5098,5251,NA,Once it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirtsleeves and go into the forge Joes prentice I should be distinguished and happy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5253,5425,NA,Now the reality was in my hold I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of smallcoal and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5427,5650,NA,There have been occasions in my later life I suppose as in most lives when I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5652,5818,NA,Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5820,6160,NA,I remember that at a later period of my time I used to stand about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6162,6341,NA,I was quite as dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that aftertime but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6343,6418,NA,It is about the only thing I  am  glad to know of myself in that connection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6420,6515,NA,For though it includes what I proceed to add all the merit of what I proceed to add was Joes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6517,6638,NA,It was not because I was faithful but because Joe was faithful that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6640,6820,NA,It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6822,7174,NA,It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honesthearted dutydoing man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has touched ones self in going by and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7176,7202,NA,What I wanted who can say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7204,7238,NA,How can  I  say when I never knew
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7240,7416,NA,What I dreaded was that in some unlucky hour I being at my grimiest and commonest should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7418,7593,NA,I was haunted by the fear that she would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7595,8086,NA,Often after dark when I was pulling the bellows for Joe and we were singing Old Clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havishams would seem to show me Estellas face in the fire with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning meoften at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8088,8267,NA,After that when we went in to supper the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever in my own ungracious breast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8269,8279,NA,Chapter XV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8281,8396,NA,As I was getting too big for Mr Wopsles greataunts room my education under that preposterous female terminated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8398,8553,NA,Not however until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8555,8759,NA,Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines      When I went to Lunnon town sirs      Too rul loo rul      Too rul loo rul      Wasnt I done very brown sirs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8766,9034,NA,Too rul loo rul      Too rul loo rul still in my desire to be wiser I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit except that I thought as I still do the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9036,9170,NA,In my hunger for information I made proposals to Mr Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9172,9485,NA,As it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic layfigure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways I soon declined that course of instruction though not until Mr Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9487,9532,NA,Whatever I acquired I tried to impart to Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9534,9619,NA,This statement sounds so well that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9621,9743,NA,I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my society and less open to Estellas reproach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9745,9933,NA,The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken slate and a short piece of slatepencil were our educational implements to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9935,10001,NA,I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another o

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,69,240,NA,Yet he would smoke his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere elseeven with a learned airas if he considered himself to be advancing immensely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,242,268,NA,Dear fellow I hope he did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,270,500,NA,It was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,502,759,NA,Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or waterline it was just the sameMiss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,761,894,NA,Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,896,1282,NA,One Sunday when Joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on being most awful dull that I had given him up for the day I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the water until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1284,1401,NA,Joe said I dont you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit Well Pip returned Joe slowly considering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1403,1429,NA,What for What for Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1431,1548,NA,What is any visit made for There is some wisits praps said Joe as for ever remains open to the question Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1550,1589,NA,But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1591,1765,NA,She might think you wanted somethingexpected something of her Dont you think I might say that I did not Joe You might old chap said Joe And she might credit it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1767,1790,NA,Similarly she mightnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1792,1922,NA,Joe felt as I did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1924,2034,NA,You see Pip Joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2036,2136,NA,When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2138,2147,NA,Yes Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2149,2201,NA,I heard her ALL Joe repeated very emphatically
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2203,2212,NA,Yes Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2214,2320,NA,I tell you I heard her Which I meantersay Pip it might be that her meaning wereMake a end on itAs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2322,2386,NA,you wasMe to the North and you to the SouthKeep in sunders
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2388,2532,NA,I had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more probable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2534,2561,NA,But Joe Yes old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2563,3023,NA,Here am I getting on in the first year of my time and since the day of my being bound I have never thanked Miss Havisham or asked after her or shown that I remember her Thats true Pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four roundand which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of hoofs I dont mean that sort of remembrance Joe I dont mean a present
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3025,3096,NA,But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3098,3433,NA,Or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front dooror say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws for general useor some light fancy article such as a toastingfork when she took her muffinsor a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like I dont mean any present at all Joe I interposed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3435,3549,NA,Well said Joe still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it if I was yourself Pip I wouldnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3551,3568,NA,No I would  not 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3570,3622,NA,For whats a doorchain when shes got one always up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3624,3671,NA,And sharkheaders is open to misrepresentations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3673,3749,NA,And if it was a toastingfork youd go into brass and do yourself no credit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3751,4190,NA,And the oncommonest workman cant show himself oncommon in a gridironfor a gridiron IS a gridiron said Joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave and you cant help yourself My dear Joe I cried in desperation taking hold of his coat dont go on in that way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4192,4244,NA,I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4246,4559,NA,No Pip Joe assented as if he had been contending for that all along and what I say to you is you are right Pip Yes Joe but what I wanted to say was that as we are rather slack just now if you would give me a halfholiday tomorrow I think I would go uptown and make a call on Miss EstHavisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4561,4656,NA,Which her name said Joe gravely aint Estavisham Pip unless she have been rechrisened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4658,4678,NA,I know Joe I know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4680,4701,NA,It was a slip of mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4703,4732,NA,What do you think of it Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4734,4807,NA,In brief Joe thought that if I thought well of it he thought well of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4809,5086,NA,But he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favour received then this experimental trip should have no successor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5088,5127,NA,By these conditions I promised to abide
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5129,5193,NA,Now Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5195,5482,NA,He pretended that his Christian name was Dolgea clear Impossibilitybut he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1082,1198,NA,Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1200,1438,NA,What could the wretched Joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs Joe and further whether he was man enough to come on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1440,1659,NA,Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway so without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went at one another like two giants

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1752,1896,NA,Orlick as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very soon among the coaldust and in no hurry to come out of it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2737,2948,NA,The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation that might do me good On the Rampage Pip and off the Rampage Pipsuch is Life

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4467,4618,NA,There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that I was at a loss what to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4620,4678,NA,She spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4680,4882,NA,When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnutshell countenance I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything and that was all I took by  that  motion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4884,5076,NA,As I was loitering along the High Street looking in disconsolately at the shop windows and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman who should come out of the bookshop but Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5078,5299,NA,Mr Wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell in which he had that moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5301,5516,NA,No sooner did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5518,5794,NA,As I knew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better than none I made no great resistance consequently we turned into Pumblechooks just as the street and the shops were lighting up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5796,6147,NA,As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell I dont know how long it may usually take but I know very well that it took until halfpast nine o clock that night and that when Mr Wopsle got into Newgate I thought he never would go to the scaffold he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6149,6331,NA,I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all as if he had not been running to seed leaf after leaf ever since his course began
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6333,6395,NA,This however was a mere question of length and wearisomeness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6397,6479,NA,What stung me was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6481,6608,NA,When Barnwell began to go wrong I declare that I felt positively apologetic Pumblechooks indignant stare so taxed me with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6610,6666,NA,Wopsle too took pains to present me in the worst light
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6668,7048,NA,At once ferocious and maudlin I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever Millwood put me down in argument on every occasion it became sheer monomania in my masters daughter to care a button for me and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning is that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7050,7370,NA,Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book Pumblechook sat staring at me and shaking his head and saying Take warning boy take warning as if it were a wellknown fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7372,7470,NA,It was a very dark night when it was all over and when I set out with Mr Wopsle on the walk home

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7539,7663,NA,The turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of the lamps usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance on the fog
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7665,7853,NA,We were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes when we came upon a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8692,8922,NA,In effect we had not walked many yards further when the wellremembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8924,8970,NA,A good night for cutting off in said Orlick

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1225,1514,NA,With my head full of George Barnwell I was at first disposed to believe that  I  must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under obligations to her I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1516,1704,NA,But when in the clearer light of next morning I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides I took another view of the case which was more reasonable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1706,1824,NA,Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen smoking his pipe from a quarter after eight oclock to a quarter before ten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1826,1960,NA,While he was there my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged Good Night with a farmlabourer going home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1962,2124,NA,The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2126,2245,NA,When Joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down on the floor and promptly called in assistance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2247,2372,NA,The fire had not then burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long the candle however had been blown out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2374,2428,NA,Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2430,2706,NA,Neither beyond the blowing out of the candlewhich stood on a table between the door and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struckwas there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such as she herself had made in falling and bleeding
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2708,2767,NA,But there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2769,2966,NA,She had been struck with something blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence as she lay on her face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2968,3075,NA,And on the ground beside her when Joe picked her up was a convicts legiron which had been filed asunder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3077,3179,NA,Now Joe examining this iron with a smiths eye declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3181,3297,NA,The hue and cry going off to the Hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron Joes opinion was corroborated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3299,3546,NA,They did not undertake to say when it had left the prisonships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3548,3632,NA,Further one of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3634,3691,NA,Knowing what I knew I set up an inference of my own here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3693,3864,NA,I believed the iron to be my convicts ironthe iron I had seen and heard him filing at on the marshesbut my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3866,3981,NA,For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3983,4042,NA,Either Orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4044,4294,NA,Now as to Orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the evening he had been in divers companies in several publichouses and he had come back with myself and Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4296,4437,NA,There was nothing against him save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with everybody else about her ten thousand times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4439,4602,NA,As to the strange man if he had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no dispute about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4604,4748,NA,Besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look round
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4750,4863,NA,It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon however undesignedly but I could hardly think otherwise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4865,5019,NA,I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5021,5143,NA,For months afterwards I every day settled the question finally in the negative and reopened and reargued it next morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5145,5301,NA,The contention came after all to thisthe secret was such an old one now had so grown into me and become a part of myself that I could not tear it away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5303,5598,NA,In addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealcutlets as a monstrous invention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5600,5862,NA,However I temporized with myself of coursefor was I not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always doneand resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5864,6115,NA,The Constables and the Bow Street men from Londonfor this happened in the days of the extinct redwaistcoated policewere about the house for a week or two and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6117,6338,NA,They took up several obviously wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6340,6581,NA,Also they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as taking the culprit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6583,6619,NA,But not quite for they never did it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6621,6704,NA,Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very ill in bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6706,6926,NA,Her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her speech was unintelligible
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6928,7120,NA,When at last she came round so far as to be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7122,7326,NA,As she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent speller and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7328,7477,NA,The administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of Tea for Joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own mistakes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7479,7540,NA,However her temper was greatly improved and she was patient
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7542,7816,NA,A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7818,7930,NA,We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7932,8065,NA,Mr Wopsles greataunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and Biddy became a part of our establishment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8067,8276,NA,It may have been about a month after my sisters reappearance in the kitchen when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8278,8853,NA,Above all she was a blessing to Joe for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were Pip Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8855,9084,NA,It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe though he never knew it and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9086,9186,NA,Biddys first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9188,9238,NA,I had tried hard at it but had made nothing of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9240,9462,NA,Thus it was Again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious T and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9464,9552,NA,I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T from tar to toast and tub
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9554,9754,NA,At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9756,9837,NA,Thereupon I had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9839,9996,NA,Then I bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and I borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9998,10001,NA,But

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,148,NA,she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,150,260,NA,When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,262,489,NA,Biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at Joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by Joe and me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,491,543,NA,Why of course cried Biddy with an exultant face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,545,559,NA,Dont you see
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,561,572,NA,Its  him 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,574,597,NA,Orlick without a doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,599,662,NA,She had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,664,928,NA,We told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,930,1038,NA,I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him and that I was disappointed by the different result
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1040,1227,NA,She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1229,1529,NA,She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1531,1731,NA,After that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without Orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1733,1745,NA,Chapter XVII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1747,1983,NA,I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1985,2160,NA,I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her and she spoke of Estella in the very same way if not in the very same words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2162,2290,NA,The interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when I was going and told me to come again on my next birthday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2292,2347,NA,I may mention at once that this became an annual custom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2349,2494,NA,I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily if I expected more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2496,2527,NA,Then and after that I took it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2529,2824,NA,So unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingtable glass that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place and while I and everything else outside it grew older it stood still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2826,2936,NA,Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2938,3043,NA,It bewildered me and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3045,3107,NA,Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy however
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3109,3198,NA,Her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3200,3323,NA,She was not beautifulshe was common and could not be like Estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3325,3570,NA,She had not been with us more than a year I remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty and very good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3572,3779,NA,It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring atwriting some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagemand seeing Biddy observant of what I was about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3781,3859,NA,I laid down my pen and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3861,3899,NA,Biddy said I how do you manage it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3901,3949,NA,Either I am very stupid or you are very clever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3951,3976,NA,What is it that I manage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3978,4016,NA,I dont know returned Biddy smiling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4018,4149,NA,She managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but I did not mean that though that made what I did mean more surprising
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4151,4252,NA,How do you manage Biddy said I to learn everything that I learn and always to keep up with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4254,4501,NA,I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge for I spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment though I have no doubt now that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4503,4652,NA,I might as well ask you said Biddy how  you  manage No because when I come in from the forge of a night any one can see me turning to at it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4654,4689,NA,But you never turn to at it Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4691,4781,NA,I suppose I must catch it like a cough said Biddy quietly and went on with her sewing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4783,4945,NA,Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4947,5101,NA,For I called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5103,5140,NA,In short whatever I knew Biddy knew
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5142,5209,NA,Theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as I or better
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5211,5284,NA,You are one of those Biddy said I who make the most of every chance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5286,5424,NA,You never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are Biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5426,5493,NA,I was your first teacher though wasnt I said she as she sewed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5495,5502,NA,Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5504,5529,NA,I exclaimed in amazement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5531,5552,NA,Why you are crying
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5554,5604,NA,No I am not said Biddy looking up and laughing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5606,5634,NA,What put that in your head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5636,5724,NA,What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5726,5906,NA,I sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr Wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5908,6137,NA,I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6139,6341,NA,I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help as a matter of course
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6343,6521,NA,Biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while I looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6523,6668,NA,I might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though I did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6670,6849,NA,Yes Biddy I observed when I had done turning it over you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this in this kitchen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6851,6882,NA,Ah poor thing replied Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6884,7113,NA,It was like her selfforgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable thats sadly true Well said I we must talk together a little more as we used to do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7115,7168,NA,And I must consult you a little more as I used to do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7170,7246,NA,Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday Biddy and a long chat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7248,7395,NA,My sister was never left alone now but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon and Biddy and I went out together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7397,7435,NA,It was summertime and lovely weather
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7437,7669,NA,When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect in my usual way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7671,7930,NA,When we came to the riverside and sat down on the bank with the water rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7932,8005,NA,Biddy said I after binding her to secrecy I want to be a gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8007,8050,NA,O I wouldnt if I was you she returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8052,8083,NA,I dont think it would answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8085,8179,NA,Biddy said I with some severity I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8181,8316,NA,You know best Pip but dont you think you are happier as you are Biddy I exclaimed impatiently I am not at all happy as I am
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8318,8365,NA,I am disgusted with my calling and with my life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8367,8414,NA,I have never taken to either since I was bound
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8416,8432,NA,Dont be absurd
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8434,8533,NA,Was I absurd said Biddy quietly raising her eyebrows I am sorry for that I didnt mean to be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8535,8585,NA,I only want you to do well and to be comfortable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8587,8710,NA,Well then understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortableor anything but miserablethere Biddyunless
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8712,8778,NA,I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8780,8846,NA,Thats a pity said Biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8848,9085,NA,Now I too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9087,9186,NA,I told her she was right and I knew it was much to be regretted but still it was not to be helped
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9188,9524,NA,If I could have settled down I said to Biddy plucking up the short grass within reach much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wallif I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little I know it would have been much better for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9526,9787,NA,You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then and Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time and I might even have grown up to keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday quite different people
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9789,9960,NA,I should have been good enough for  you  shouldnt I Biddy Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for answer Yes I am not overparticular
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9962,10001,NA,It scarcely sounded flattering but I kn

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,21,121,NA,Instead of that said I plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two see how I am going on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,123,364,NA,Dissatisfied and uncomfortable andwhat would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me so Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,366,478,NA,It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she remarked directing her eyes to the ships again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,480,493,NA,Who said it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,495,578,NA,I was disconcerted for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,580,807,NA,It was not to be shuffled off now however and I answered The beautiful young lady at Miss Havishams and shes more beautiful than anybody ever was and I admire her dreadfully and I want to be a gentleman on her account
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,809,937,NA,Having made this lunatic confession I began to throw my tornup grass into the river as if I had some thoughts of following it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,939,1004,NA,Do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1006,1043,NA,Biddy quietly asked me after a pause
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1045,1079,NA,I dont know I moodily answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1081,1244,NA,Because if it is to spite her Biddy pursued I should thinkbut you know bestthat might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1246,1341,NA,And if it is to gain her over I should thinkbut you know bestshe was not worth gaining over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1343,1388,NA,Exactly what I myself had thought many times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1390,1445,NA,Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1447,1577,NA,But how could I a poor dazed village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1579,1653,NA,It may be all quite true said I to Biddy but I admire her dreadfully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1655,1789,NA,In short I turned over on my face when I came to that and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1791,2048,NA,All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right if I had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2050,2120,NA,Biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2122,2264,NA,She put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2266,2519,NA,Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a littleexactly as I had done in the brewery yardand felt vaguely convinced that I was very much illused by somebody or by everybody I cant say which
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2521,2630,NA,I am glad of one thing said Biddy and that is that you have felt you could give me your confidence Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2632,2765,NA,And I am glad of another thing and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2767,2794,NA,If your first teacher dear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2796,2948,NA,such a poor one and so much in need of being taught herself had been your teacher at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2950,3039,NA,But it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and its of no use now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3041,3316,NA,So with a quiet sigh for me Biddy rose from the bank and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice Shall we walk a little farther or go home Biddy I cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving her a kiss I shall always tell you everything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3318,3355,NA,Till youre a gentleman said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3357,3401,NA,You know I never shall be so thats always
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3403,3524,NA,Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything for you know everything I knowas I told you at home the other night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3526,3595,NA,Ah said Biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3597,3693,NA,And then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a little farther or go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3695,3844,NA,I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very beautiful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3846,4075,NA,I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing beggar my neighbour by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks and being despised by Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4077,4304,NA,I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do and stick to it and make the best of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4306,4455,NA,I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy she would make me miserable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4457,4638,NA,I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty and I said to myself Pip what a fool you are We talked a good deal as we walked and all that Biddy said seemed right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4640,4857,NA,Biddy was never insulting or capricious or Biddy today and somebody else tomorrow she would have derived only pain and no pleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4859,4932,NA,How could it be then that I did not like her much the better of the two
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4934,5013,NA,Biddy said I when we were walking homeward I wish you could put me right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5015,5043,NA,I wish I could said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5045,5164,NA,If I could only get myself to fall in love with youyou dont mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5166,5199,NA,Oh dear not at all said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5201,5289,NA,Dont mind me If I could only get myself to do it  that  would be the thing for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5291,5332,NA,But you never will you see said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5334,5453,NA,It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5455,5504,NA,I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5506,5558,NA,But Biddy said she  was  and she said it decisively
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5560,5678,NA,In my heart I believed her to be right and yet I took it rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5680,5784,NA,When we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and get over a stile near a sluicegate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5786,5905,NA,There started up from the gate or from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way Old Orlick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5907,5954,NA,Halloa he growled where are you two going
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5956,6055,NA,Where should we be going but home Well then said he Im jiggered if I dont see you home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6057,6130,NA,This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of his
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6132,6317,NA,He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of but used it like his own pretended Christian name to affront mankind and convey an idea of something savagely damaging
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6319,6456,NA,When I was younger I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6458,6567,NA,Biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper Dont let him come I dont like him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6569,6679,NA,As I did not like him either I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didnt want seeing home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6681,6810,NA,He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little distance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6812,6998,NA,Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account I asked her why she did not like him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7000,7143,NA,Oh she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us because II am afraid he likes me Did he ever tell you he liked you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7145,7164,NA,I asked indignantly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7166,7290,NA,No said Biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me so but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7292,7399,NA,However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7401,7504,NA,I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlicks daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7506,7571,NA,But it makes no difference to you you know said Biddy calmly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7573,7659,NA,No Biddy it makes no difference to me only I dont like it I dont approve of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7661,7688,NA,Nor I neither said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7690,7856,NA,Though  that  makes no difference to you Exactly said I but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you Biddy if he danced at you with your own consent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7858,8013,NA,I kept an eye on Orlick after that night and whenever circumstances were favourable to his dancing at Biddy got before him to obscure that demonstration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8015,8148,NA,He had struck root in Joes establishment by reason of my sisters sudden fancy for him or I should have tried to get him dismissed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8150,8241,NA,He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as I had reason to know thereafter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8243,8600,NA,And now because my mind was not confused enough before I complicated its confusion fifty thousandfold by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of selfrespect and happiness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8602,8946,NA,At those times I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddywhen all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter my wits again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8948,9189,NA,Scattered wits take a long time picking up and often before I had got them well together they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9191,9287,NA,If my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities I dare say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9289,9378,NA,It never did run out however but was brought to a premature end as I proceed to relate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9380,9393,NA,Chapter XVIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9395,9477,NA,It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe and it was a Saturday night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9479,9605,NA,There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen attentive to Mr Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9607,9630,NA,Of that group I was one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9632,9727,NA,A highly popular murder had been committed and Mr Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9729,9847,NA,He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9849,9966,NA,He faintly moaned I am done for as the victim and he barbarously bellowed Ill serve you out as the murderer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9968,10001,NA,He gave the medical testimony in 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,1936,1936,person,I
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,8679,8681,person,Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,8767,8769,person,Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,9445,9447,person,Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,220,NA,pointed imitation of our local practitioner and he piped and shook as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard blows to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,222,304,NA,The coroner in Mr Wopsles hands became Timon of Athens the beadle Coriolanus
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,306,400,NA,He enjoyed himself thoroughly and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,402,466,NA,In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,468,587,NA,Then and not sooner I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me looking on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,589,712,NA,There was an expression of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,714,849,NA,Well said the stranger to Mr Wopsle when the reading was done you have settled it all to your own satisfaction I have no doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,851,910,NA,Everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,912,959,NA,He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,961,1003,NA,Guilty of course said he Out with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1005,1105,NA,Come Sir returned Mr Wopsle without having the honour of your acquaintance I do say Guilty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1107,1170,NA,Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1172,1225,NA,I know you do said the stranger I knew you would
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1227,1240,NA,I told you so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1242,1273,NA,But now Ill ask you a question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1275,1406,NA,Do you know or do you not know that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent until he is provedprovedto be guilty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1408,1527,NA,Sir Mr Wopsle began to reply as an Englishman myself I Come said the stranger biting his forefinger at him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1529,1554,NA,Dont evade the question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1556,1596,NA,Either you know it or you dont know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1598,1616,NA,Which is it to be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1618,1807,NA,He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at Mr Wopsleas it were to mark him outbefore biting it again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1809,1863,NA,Now said he Do you know it or dont you know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1865,1906,NA,Certainly I know it replied Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1908,1930,NA,Certainly you know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1932,1967,NA,Then why didnt you say so at first
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1969,2141,NA,Now Ill ask you another questiontaking possession of Mr Wopsle as if he had a right to him do  you know that none of these witnesses have yet been crossexamined
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2143,2216,NA,Mr Wopsle was beginning I can only say when the stranger stopped him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2218,2223,NA,What
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2225,2265,NA,You wont answer the question yes or no
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2267,2291,NA,Now Ill try you again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2293,2325,NA,Throwing his finger at him again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2327,2340,NA,Attend to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2342,2436,NA,Are you aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been crossexamined
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2438,2473,NA,Come I only want one word from you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2475,2486,NA,Yes or no
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2488,2567,NA,Mr Wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2569,2610,NA,Come said the stranger Ill help you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2612,2653,NA,You dont deserve help but Ill help you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2655,2695,NA,Look at that paper you hold in your hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2697,2708,NA,What is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2710,2722,NA,What is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2724,2770,NA,repeated Mr Wopsle eyeing it much at a loss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2772,2898,NA,Is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner the printed paper you have just been reading from
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2900,2913,NA,Undoubtedly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2915,2927,NA,Undoubtedly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2929,3145,NA,Now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence I read that just now Mr Wopsle pleaded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3147,3226,NA,Never mind what you read just now sir I dont ask you what you read just now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3228,3323,NA,You may read the Lords Prayer backwards if you likeand perhaps have done it before today
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3325,3342,NA,Turn to the paper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3344,3452,NA,No no no my friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to the bottom to the bottom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3454,3507,NA,We all began to think Mr Wopsle full of subterfuge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3509,3514,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3516,3534,NA,Have you found it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3536,3565,NA,Here it is said Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3567,3756,NA,Now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3758,3787,NA,Come Do you make that of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3789,3841,NA,Mr Wopsle answered Those are not the exact words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3843,3897,NA,Not the exact words repeated the gentleman bitterly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3899,3928,NA,Is that the exact substance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3930,3952,NA,Yes said Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3954,4081,NA,Yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4083,4276,NA,And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellowcreature guilty unheard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4278,4395,NA,We all began to suspect that Mr Wopsle was not the man we had thought him and that he was beginning to be found out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4397,5039,NA,And that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his finger at Mr Wopsle heavilythat same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help him God We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5041,5460,NA,The strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5462,5645,NA,From information I have received said he looking round at us as we all quailed before him I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you by name Josephor JoeGargery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5647,5693,NA,Which is the man Here is the man said Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5695,5760,NA,The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and Joe went
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5762,5832,NA,You have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5834,5845,NA,Is he here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5847,5858,NA,I am here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5860,5867,NA,I cried
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5869,6018,NA,The stranger did not recognise me but I recognised him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6020,6382,NA,I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder I checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his deepset eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watchchain his strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6384,6483,NA,I wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had surveyed me at his leisure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6485,6512,NA,It will take a little time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6514,6565,NA,Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6567,6733,NA,I prefer not to anticipate my communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards I have nothing to do with that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6735,6844,NA,Amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen and in a wondering silence walked home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6846,6957,NA,While going along the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of his finger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6959,7091,NA,As we neared home Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7093,7177,NA,Our conference was held in the state parlour which was feebly lighted by one candle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7179,7319,NA,It began with the strange gentlemans sitting down at the table drawing the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocketbook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7321,7471,NA,He then put up the pocketbook and set the candle a little aside after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me to ascertain which was which
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7473,7533,NA,My name he said is Jaggers and I am a lawyer in London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7535,7557,NA,I am pretty well known
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7559,7666,NA,I have unusual business to transact with you and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7668,7724,NA,If my advice had been asked I should not have been here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7726,7763,NA,It was not asked and you see me here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7765,7825,NA,What I have to do as the confidential agent of another I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7827,7844,NA,No less no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7846,8055,NA,Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8057,8158,NA,Now Joseph Gargery I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8160,8237,NA,You would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8239,8367,NA,You would want nothing for so doing Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pips way said Joe staring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8369,8441,NA,Lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8443,8484,NA,The question is Would you want anything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8486,8507,NA,Do you want anything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8509,8553,NA,The answer is returned Joe sternly No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8555,8649,NA,I thought Mr Jaggers glanced at Joe as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8651,8740,NA,But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise to be sure of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8742,8771,NA,Very well said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8773,8851,NA,Recollect the admission you have made and dont try to go from it presently
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8853,8889,NA,Whos agoing to try retorted Joe

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9061,9167,NA,repeated Mr Jaggers shutting his eyes and nodding his head at Joe as if he were forgiving him something
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9169,9204,NA,Now I return to this young fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9206,9282,NA,And the communication I have got to make is that he has great expectations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9284,9327,NA,Joe and I gasped and looked at one another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9329,9467,NA,I am instructed to communicate to him said Mr Jaggers throwing his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9469,9712,NA,Further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place and be brought up as a gentlemanin a word as a young fellow of great expectations

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,62,NA,m I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,64,172,NA,You will have no objection I dare say to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,174,236,NA,But if you have any objection this is the time to mention it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,238,357,NA,My heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,359,378,NA,I should think not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,380,549,NA,Now you are to understand secondly Mr Pip that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret until the person chooses to reveal it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,551,671,NA,I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,673,750,NA,When or where that intention may be carried out I cannot say no one can say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,752,773,NA,It may be years hence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,775,1034,NA,Now you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however distant to any individual whomsoever as  the  individual in all the communications you may have with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1036,1118,NA,If you have a suspicion in your own breast keep that suspicion in your own breast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1120,1268,NA,It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are they may be the strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1270,1305,NA,This is not for you to inquire into
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1307,1333,NA,The condition is laid down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1335,1543,NA,Your acceptance of it and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition that I am charged with by the person from whom I take my instructions and for whom I am not otherwise responsible
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1545,1665,NA,That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by that person and by me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1667,1819,NA,Again not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it this is the time to mention it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1821,1831,NA,Speak out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1833,1895,NA,Once more I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1897,1916,NA,I should think not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1918,1962,NA,Now Mr Pip I have done with stipulations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1964,2289,NA,Though he called me Mr Pip and began rather to make up to me he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement if he only chose to mention them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2291,2336,NA,We come next to mere details of arrangement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2338,2461,NA,You must know that although I have used the term expectations more than once you are not endowed with expectations only
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2463,2574,NA,There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2576,2617,NA,You will please consider me your guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2619,2728,NA,Oh for I was going to thank him I tell you at once I am paid for my services or I shouldnt render them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2730,2920,NA,It is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2922,2955,NA,I said I had always longed for it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2957,3044,NA,Never mind what you have always longed for Mr Pip he retorted keep to the record
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3046,3083,NA,If you long for it now thats enough
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3085,3162,NA,Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3164,3175,NA,Is that it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3177,3205,NA,I stammered yes that was it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3207,3212,NA,Good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3214,3256,NA,Now your inclinations are to be consulted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3258,3306,NA,I dont think that wise mind but its my trust
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3308,3374,NA,Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3376,3475,NA,I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr Wopsles greataunt so I replied in the negative
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3477,3588,NA,There is a certain tutor of whom I have some knowledge who I think might suit the purpose said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3590,3656,NA,I dont recommend him observe because I never recommend anybody
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3658,3709,NA,The gentleman I speak of is one Mr Matthew Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3711,3713,NA,Ah

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3746,3770,NA,Miss Havishams relation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3772,3823,NA,The Matthew whom Mr and Mrs Camilla had spoken of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3825,3944,NA,The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havishams head when she lay dead in her brides dress on the brides table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3946,4068,NA,You know the name said Mr Jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4070,4113,NA,My answer was that I had heard of the name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4115,4157,NA,Oh said he You have heard of the name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4159,4202,NA,But the question is what do you say of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4204,4357,NA,I said or tried to say that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation No my young friend he interrupted shaking his great head very slowly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4359,4379,NA,Recollect yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4381,4656,NA,Not recollecting myself I began again that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation No my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at onceno no no its very well done but it wont do you are too young to fix me with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4658,4697,NA,Recommendation is not the word Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4699,4711,NA,Try another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4713,4832,NA,Correcting myself I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention of Mr Matthew Pocket  That s more like it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4834,4855,NA,cried Mr JaggersAnd
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4857,4901,NA,I added I would gladly try that gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4903,4908,NA,Good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4910,4949,NA,You had better try him in his own house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4951,5033,NA,The way shall be prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5035,5064,NA,When will you come to London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5066,5163,NA,I said glancing at Joe who stood looking on motionless that I supposed I could come directly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5165,5276,NA,First said Mr Jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in and they should not be workingclothes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5278,5295,NA,Say this day week
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5297,5319,NA,Youll want some money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5321,5354,NA,Shall I leave you twenty guineas
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5356,5470,NA,He produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5472,5531,NA,This was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5533,5637,NA,He sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5639,5660,NA,Well Joseph Gargery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5662,5731,NA,You look dumbfoundered I  am  said Joe in a very decided manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5733,5799,NA,It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5801,5855,NA,It were understood said Joe And it are understood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5857,5895,NA,And it ever will be similar according
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5897,6021,NA,But what said Mr Jaggers swinging his pursewhat if it was in my instructions to make you a present as compensation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6023,6049,NA,As compensation what for
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6051,6063,NA,Joe demanded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6065,6095,NA,For the loss of his services
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6097,6157,NA,Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6159,6301,NA,I have often thought him since like the steamhammer that can crush a man or pat an eggshell in his combination of strength with gentleness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6303,6421,NA,Pip is that hearty welcome said Joe to go free with his services to honour and fortun as no words can tell him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6423,6759,NA,But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little childwhat come to the forgeand ever the best of friends O dear good Joe whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to I see you again with your muscular blacksmiths arm before your eyes and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6761,6914,NA,O dear good faithful tender Joe I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angels wing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6916,6948,NA,But I encouraged Joe at the time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6950,7055,NA,I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes and could not retrace the bypaths we had trodden together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7057,7177,NA,I begged Joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best of friends and as I said we ever would be so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7179,7291,NA,Joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but said not another word
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7293,7396,NA,Mr Jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognised in Joe the village idiot and in me his keeper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7398,7538,NA,When it was over he said weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing Now Joseph Gargery I warn you this is your last chance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7540,7564,NA,No half measures with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7566,7666,NA,If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge to make you speak out and you shall have it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7668,7839,NA,If on the contrary you mean to say Here to his great amazement he was stopped by Joes suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7841,7945,NA,Which I meantersay cried Joe that if you come into my place bullbaiting and badgering me come out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7947,7998,NA,Which I meantersay as sech if youre a man come on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8000,8070,NA,Which I meantersay that what I say I meantersay and stand or fall by
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8072,8322,NA,I drew Joe away and he immediately became placable merely stating to me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern that he were not agoing to be bullbaited and badgered in his own place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8324,8397,NA,Mr Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated and had backed near the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8399,8492,NA,Without evincing any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory remarks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8494,8509,NA,They were these
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8511,8600,NA,Well Mr Pip I think the sooner you leave hereas you are to be a gentlemanthe better

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8866,8907,NA,I am paid for undertaking it and I do so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8909,8938,NA,Now understand that finally
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8940,8956,NA,Understand that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8958,9089,NA,He was throwing his finger at both of us and I think would have gone on but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous and going off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9091,9232,NA,Something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was going down to the Jolly Bargemen where he had left a hired carriage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9234,9266,NA,I beg your pardon Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9268,9320,NA,Halloa said he facing round whats the matter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9322,9423,NA,I wish to be quite right Mr Jaggers and to keep to your directions so I thought I had better ask
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9425,9575,NA,Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know about here before I go away No said he looking as if he hardly understood me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9577,9655,NA,I dont mean in the village only but up town No said he No objection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9657,9880,NA,I thanked him and ran home again and there I found that Joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the burning coals
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9882,9973,NA,I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals and nothing was said for a long time

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,152,NA,oned chair in her corner and Biddy sat at her needlework before the fire and Joe sat next Biddy and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,154,305,NA,The more I looked into the glowing coals the more incapable I became of looking at Joe the longer the silence lasted the more unable I felt to speak
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,307,652,NA,At length I got out Joe have you told Biddy No Pip returned Joe still looking at the fire and holding his knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere which I left it to yourself Pip I would rather you told Joe Pips a gentleman of fortun then said Joe and God bless him in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,654,694,NA,Biddy dropped her work and looked at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,696,731,NA,Joe held his knees and looked at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,733,757,NA,I looked at both of them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,759,899,NA,After a pause they both heartily congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,901,1083,NA,I took it upon myself to impress Biddy and through Biddy Joe with the grave obligation I considered my friends under to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1085,1247,NA,It would all come out in good time I observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1249,1593,NA,Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again and said she would be very particular and Joe still detaining his knees said Ay ay Ill be ekervally partickler Pip and then they congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I didnt half like it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1595,1688,NA,Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1690,1745,NA,To the best of my belief those efforts entirely failed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1747,1860,NA,She laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even repeated after Biddy the words Pip and Property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1862,1987,NA,But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1989,2124,NA,I never could have believed it without experience but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again I became quite gloomy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2126,2273,NA,Dissatisfied with my fortune of course I could not be but it is possible that I may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied with myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2275,2458,NA,Anyhow I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and about what they should do without me and all that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2460,2650,NA,And whenever I caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they often looked at meparticularly Biddy I felt offended as if they were expressing some mistrust of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2652,2702,NA,Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2704,2861,NA,At those times I would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to air the room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2863,3030,NA,The very stars to which I then raised my eyes I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3032,3112,NA,Saturday night said I when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3114,3164,NA,Five more days and then the day before  the  day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3166,3252,NA,Theyll soon go Yes Pip observed Joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3254,3300,NA,Theyll soon go Soon soon go said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3302,3502,NA,I have been thinking Joe that when I go down town on Monday and order my new clothes I shall tell the tailor that Ill come and put them on there or that Ill have them sent to Mr Pumblechooks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3504,3573,NA,It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3575,3578,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3580,3847,NA,and Mrs Hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure too Pip said Joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3849,3865,NA,So might Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3867,3920,NA,And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3922,3957,NA,Thats just what I dont want Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3959,4061,NA,They would make such a business of itsuch a coarse and common businessthat I couldnt bear myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4063,4278,NA,Ah that indeed Pip said Joe If you couldnt abear yourself Biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sisters plate Have you thought about when youll show yourself to Mr Gargery and your sister and me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4280,4651,NA,You will show yourself to us wont you Biddy I returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick that its difficult to keep up with you She always were quick observed Joe If you had waited another moment Biddy you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one eveningmost likely on the evening before I go away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4653,4671,NA,Biddy said no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4673,4779,NA,Handsomely forgiving her I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and Joe and went up to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4781,4934,NA,When I got into my little room I sat down and took a long look at it as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above for ever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4936,5208,NA,It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havishams and Biddy and Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5210,5298,NA,The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and the room was warm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5300,5504,NA,As I put the window open and stood looking out I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two in the air and then I saw Biddy come and bring him a pipe and light it for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5506,5610,NA,He never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting for some reason or other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5612,5852,NA,He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe and Biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and I knew that they talked of me for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5854,6117,NA,I would not have listened for more if I could have heard more so I drew away from the window and sat down in my one chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6119,6332,NA,Looking towards the open window I saw light wreaths from Joes pipe floating there and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joenot obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6334,6456,NA,I put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy bed now and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6458,6469,NA,Chapter XIX
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6471,6600,NA,Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6602,6898,NA,What lay heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile and that when I got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6900,7032,NA,Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation but they only referred to it when I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7034,7172,NA,After breakfast Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour and we put them in the fire and I felt that I was free
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7174,7371,NA,With all the novelty of my emancipation on me I went to church with Joe and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnt have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven if he had known all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7373,7486,NA,After our early dinner I strolled out alone purposing to finish off the marshes at once and get them done with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7488,7741,NA,As I passed the church I felt as I had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there Sunday after Sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7743,7974,NA,I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roastbeef and plumpudding a pint of ale and a gallon of condescension upon everybody in the village
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7976,8251,NA,If I had often thought before with something allied to shame of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves what were my thoughts on this Sunday when the place recalled the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8253,8434,NA,My comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might be veritably dead into the bargain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8436,8853,NA,No more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these grazing cattlethough they seemed in their dull manner to wear a more respectful air now and to face round in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectationsfarewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood henceforth I was for London and greatness not for smiths work in general and for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8855,9003,NA,I made my exultant way to the old Battery and lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella fell asleep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9005,9087,NA,When I awoke I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me smoking his pipe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9089,9210,NA,He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes and said As being the last time Pip I thought Id foller
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9212,9248,NA,And Joe I am very glad you did so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9250,9364,NA,Thankee Pip You may be sure dear Joe I went on after we had shaken hands that I shall never forget you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9366,9433,NA,No no Pip said Joe in a comfortable tone  I m sure of that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9435,9451,NA,Ay ay old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9453,9544,NA,Bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in a mans mind to be certain on it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9546,9639,NA,But it took a bit of time to get it well round the change come so oncommon plump didnt it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9641,9714,NA,Somehow I was not best pleased with Joes being so mightily secure of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9716,9835,NA,I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said It does you credit Pip or something of that sort
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9837,10001,NA,Therefore I made no remark on Joes first head merely saying as to his second that the tidings had indeed come suddenly but that I had always wanted to be a gent

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,77,NA,tleman and had often and often speculated on what I would do if I were one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,79,121,NA,Have you though said Joe Astonishing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,123,234,NA,Its a pity now Joe said I that you did not get on a little more when we had our lessons here isnt it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,236,270,NA,Well I dont know returned Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,272,290,NA,Im so awful dull
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,292,323,NA,Im only master of my own trade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,325,638,NA,It were always a pity as I was so awful dull but its no more of a pity now than it wasthis day twelvemonthdont you see What I had meant was that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Joe it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,640,749,NA,He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning however that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,751,997,NA,So when we had walked home and had had tea I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits that I should never forget her said I had a favour to ask of her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,999,1095,NA,And it is Biddy said I that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Joe on a little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1097,1117,NA,How helping him on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1119,1160,NA,asked Biddy with a steady sort of glance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1162,1167,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1169,1295,NA,Joe is a dear good fellowin fact I think he is the dearest fellow that ever livedbut he is rather backward in some things
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1297,1350,NA,For instance Biddy in his learning and his manners
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1352,1497,NA,Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken she did not look at me O his manners
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1499,1525,NA,wont his manners do then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1527,1569,NA,asked Biddy plucking a blackcurrant leaf
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1571,1641,NA,My dear Biddy they do very well here O they  do  very well here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1643,1701,NA,interrupted Biddy looking closely at the leaf in her hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1703,1866,NA,Hear me outbut if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere as I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property they would hardly do him justice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1868,1916,NA,And dont you think he knows that asked Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1918,2311,NA,It was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me that I said snappishly Biddy what do you mean Biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her handsand the smell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lanesaid Have you never considered that he may be proud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2313,2320,NA,Proud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2322,2358,NA,I repeated with disdainful emphasis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2360,2486,NA,O there are many kinds of pride said Biddy looking full at me and shaking her head pride is not all of one kind Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2488,2560,NA,What are you stopping for said I Not all of one kind resumed Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2562,2683,NA,He may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well and with respect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2685,2805,NA,To tell you the truth I think he is though it sounds bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2807,2864,NA,Now Biddy said I I am very sorry to see this in you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2866,2901,NA,I did not expect to see this in you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2903,2939,NA,You are envious Biddy and grudging
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2941,3026,NA,You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you cant help showing it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3028,3088,NA,If you have the heart to think so returned Biddy say so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3090,3271,NA,Say so over and over again if you have the heart to think so If you have the heart to be so you mean Biddy said I in a virtuous and superior tone dont put it off upon me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3273,3342,NA,I am very sorry to see it and its aits a bad side of human nature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3344,3454,NA,I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone of improving dear Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3456,3488,NA,But after this I ask you nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3490,3549,NA,I am extremely sorry to see this in you Biddy I repeated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3551,3591,NA,Its aits a bad side of human nature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3593,3745,NA,Whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor Biddy you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here at all times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3747,3838,NA,And whatever opinion you take away of me shall make no difference in my remembrance of you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3840,3920,NA,Yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither said Biddy turning away her head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3922,4387,NA,I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment waiving its application I have since seen reason to think I was right and I walked down the little path away from Biddy and Biddy went into the house and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until suppertime again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4389,4495,NA,But morning once more brightened my view and I extended my clemency to Biddy and we dropped the subject
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4497,4793,NA,Putting on the best clothes I had I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open and presented myself before Mr Trabb the tailor who was having his breakfast in the parlour behind his shop and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me but called me in to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4795,4856,NA,Well said Mr Trabb in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4858,4898,NA,How are you and what can I do for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4900,5026,NA,Mr Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three featherbeds and was slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5028,5295,NA,He was a prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace and I did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5297,5300,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5302,5437,NA,Trabb said I its an unpleasant thing to have to mention because it looks like boasting but I have come into a handsome property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5439,5469,NA,A change passed over Mr Trabb
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5471,5768,NA,He forgot the butter in bed got up from the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming Lord bless my soul I am going up to my guardian in London said I casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them and I want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5770,5877,NA,I wish to pay for them I addedotherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5879,6060,NA,My dear sir said Mr Trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow dont hurt me by mentioning that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6062,6095,NA,May I venture to congratulate you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6097,6150,NA,Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6152,6219,NA,Mr Trabbs boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6221,6318,NA,When I had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his labours by sweeping over me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6320,6532,NA,He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr Trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles to express as I understood it equality with any blacksmith alive or dead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6534,6662,NA,Hold that noise said Mr Trabb with the greatest sternness or Ill knock your head offDo me the favour to be seated sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6664,6861,NA,Now this said Mr Trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss is a very sweet article
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6863,6937,NA,I can recommend it for your purpose sir because it really is extra super
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6939,6968,NA,But you shall see some others
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6970,7150,NA,Give me Number Four you To the boy and with a dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreants brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7152,7285,NA,Mr Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7287,7347,NA,Then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7349,7488,NA,And let me have none of your tricks here said Mr Trabb or you shall repent it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7490,7837,NA,Mr Trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellowtownsmans if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman having worn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7839,7993,NA,Are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said Mr Trabb to the boy after that or shall I kick you out of the shop and bring them myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7995,8118,NA,I selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of Mr Trabbs judgment and reentered the parlour to be measured
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8120,8314,NA,For although Mr Trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented with it he said apologetically that it wouldnt do under existing circumstances sirwouldnt do at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8316,8555,NA,So Mr Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlour as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8557,8905,NA,When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr Pumblechooks on the Thursday evening he said with his hand upon the parlour lock I know sir that London gentlemen cannot be expected to patronise local work as a rule but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman I should greatly esteem it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8907,8945,NA,Goodmorning sir much obligedDoor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8947,9025,NA,The last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what it meant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9027,9214,NA,But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was that it had morally laid upon his back Trabbs boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9216,9401,NA,After this memorable event I went to the hatters and the bootmakers and the hosiers and felt rather like Mother Hubbards dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9403,9490,NA,I also went to the coachoffice and took my place for seven oclock on Saturday morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9492,9775,NA,It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property but whenever I said anything to that effect it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High Street and concentrated his mind upon me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9777,9947,NA,When I had ordered everything I wanted I directed my steps towards Pumblechooks and as I approached that gentlemans place of business I saw him standing at his door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9949,9992,NA,He was waiting for me with great impatience

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,86,232,NA,He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour and he too ordered his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,234,379,NA,My dear friend said Mr Pumblechook taking me by both hands when he and I and the collation were alone I give you joy of your good fortune
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,381,410,NA,Well deserved well deserved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,412,495,NA,This was coming to the point and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,497,669,NA,To think said Mr Pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for some moments that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this is a proud reward
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,671,765,NA,I begged Mr Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted on that point
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,767,1228,NA,My dear young friend said Mr Pumblechook if you will allow me to call you so I murmured Certainly and Mr Pumblechook took me by both hands again and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional appearance though it was rather low down My dear young friend rely upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before the mind of JosephJoseph said Mr Pumblechook in the way of a compassionate adjuration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1230,1338,NA,Joseph Joseph Thereupon he shook his head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1340,1432,NA,But my dear young friend said Mr Pumblechook you must be hungry you must be exhausted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1434,1443,NA,Be seated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1445,1618,NA,Here is a chicken had round from the Boar here is a tongue had round from the Boar heres one or two little things had round from the Boar that I hope you may not despise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1620,1775,NA,But do I said Mr Pumblechook getting up again the moment after he had sat down see afore me him as I ever sported with in his times of happy infancy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1777,1796,NA,And may I may  I
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1798,1836,NA,This May I meant might he shake hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1838,1894,NA,I consented and he was fervent and then sat down again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1896,1932,NA,Here is wine said Mr Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1934,2028,NA,Let us drink Thanks to Fortune and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2030,2273,NA,And yet I cannot said Mr Pumblechook getting up again see afore me Oneand likewise drink to Onewithout again expressingMay I may  I I said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his glass and turned it upside down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2275,2398,NA,I did the same and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2400,2597,NA,Mr Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of tongue none of those outoftheway No Thoroughfares of Pork now and took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2599,2620,NA,Ah poultry poultry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2622,2760,NA,You little thought said Mr Pumblechook apostrophising the fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2762,3026,NA,You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one asCall it a weakness if you will said Mr Pumblechook getting up again but may I  may  I It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so he did it at once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3028,3108,NA,How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife I dont know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3110,3219,NA,And your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had the honour of bringing you up by hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3221,3311,NA,Its a sad picter to reflect that shes no longer equal to fully understanding the honour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3313,3376,NA,May I saw he was about to come at me again and I stopped him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3378,3676,NA,Well drink her health said I Ah cried Mr Pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid with admiration thats the way you know em sir I dont know who Sir was but he certainly was not I and there was no third person present thats the way you know the nobleminded sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3678,3709,NA,Ever forgiving and ever affable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3711,3949,NA,It might said the servile Pumblechook putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person have the appearance of repeatingbut  may  I When he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3951,4061,NA,Let us never be blind said Mr Pumblechook to her faults of temper but it is to be hoped she meant well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4063,4202,NA,At about this time I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face as to myself I felt all face steeped in wine and smarting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4204,4338,NA,I mentioned to Mr Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4340,4441,NA,I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village and he lauded it to the skies
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4443,4534,NA,There was nobody but himself he intimated worthy of my confidence andin short might he
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4536,4738,NA,Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4740,4929,NA,If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4931,5080,NA,Yet for all that I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him and that he was a sensible practical goodhearted prime fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5082,5193,NA,By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5195,5403,NA,He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighbourhood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5405,5498,NA,What alone was wanting to the realisation of a vast fortune he considered to be More Capital
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5500,5545,NA,Those were the two little words more capital
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5547,6030,NA,Now it appeared to him Pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a sleeping partner sirwhich sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine the booksand walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket to the tune of fifty per centit appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property which would be worthy of his attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6032,6052,NA,But what did I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6054,6113,NA,He had great confidence in my opinion and what did I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6115,6138,NA,I gave it as my opinion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6140,6152,NA,Wait a bit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6154,6308,NA,The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me but said he really mustand did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6310,6520,NA,We drank all the wine and Mr Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark I dont know what mark and to render me efficient and constant service I dont know what service
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6522,6749,NA,He also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me That boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common fortun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6751,6843,NA,He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now and I said so too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6845,7065,NA,Finally I went out into the air with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7067,7118,NA,There I was roused by Mr Pumblechooks hailing me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7120,7210,NA,He was a long way down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to stop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7212,7248,NA,I stopped and he came up breathless
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7250,7318,NA,No my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7320,7341,NA,Not if I can help it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7343,7421,NA,This occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your partMay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7423,7458,NA,I as an old friend and wellwisher
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7461,7591,NA,May  I We shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7593,7779,NA,Then he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7781,7894,NA,I had scant luggage to take with me to London for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7896,8056,NA,But I began packing that same afternoon and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8058,8213,NA,So Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday passed and on Friday morning I went to Mr Pumblechooks to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8215,8333,NA,Mr Pumblechooks own room was given up to me to dress in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8335,8385,NA,My clothes were rather a disappointment of course
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8387,8517,NA,Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell a trifle short of the wearers expectation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8519,8738,NA,But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr Pumblechooks very limited dressingglass in the futile endeavour to see my legs it seemed to fit me better
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8740,8838,NA,It being market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off Mr Pumblechook was not at home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8840,8955,NA,I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8957,9171,NA,This was all as it should be and I went out in my new array fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage something like Joes in his Sunday suit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9173,9319,NA,I went circuitously to Miss Havishams by all the back ways and rang at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9321,9482,NA,Sarah Pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed her walnutshell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9484,9505,NA,You said she You
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9507,9520,NA,Good gracious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9522,9629,NA,What do you want I am going to London Miss Pocket said I and want to say goodbye to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9631,9733,NA,I was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went to ask if I were to be admitted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9735,9815,NA,After a very short delay she returned and took me up staring at me all the way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9817,9918,NA,Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table leaning on her crutch stick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9920,10001,NA,The room was lighted as of yore and at the sound of our entrance she stopped and

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,92,420,NA,Well Pip I start for London Miss Havisham tomorrow I was exceedingly careful what I said and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you This is a gay figure Pip said she making her crutch stick play round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were bestowing the finishing gift
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,422,506,NA,I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last Miss Havisham I murmured
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,508,632,NA,And I am so grateful for it Miss Havisham Ay ay said she looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah with delight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,634,658,NA,I have seen Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,661,688,NA,I  have heard about it Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,690,710,NA,So you go tomorrow

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,830,869,NA,And Mr Jaggers is made your guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,871,891,NA,Yes Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,893,1001,NA,She quite gloated on these questions and answers so keen was her enjoyment of Sarah Pockets jealous dismay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1003,1063,NA,Well she went on you have a promising career before you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1065,1124,NA,Be gooddeserve itand abide by Mr Jaggerss instructions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1126,1233,NA,She looked at me and looked at Sarah and Sarahs countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1235,1298,NA,Goodbye Pipyou will always keep the name of Pip you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1300,1320,NA,Yes Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1322,1337,NA,Goodbye Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1339,1415,NA,She stretched out her hand and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1417,1518,NA,I had not considered how I should take leave of her it came naturally to me at the moment to do this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1520,1757,NA,She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes and so I left my fairy godmother with both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bridecake that was hidden in cobwebs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1759,1832,NA,Sarah Pocket conducted me down as if I were a ghost who must be seen out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1834,1909,NA,She could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree confounded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1911,2025,NA,I said Goodbye Miss Pocket but she merely stared and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2027,2273,NA,Clear of the house I made the best of my way back to Pumblechooks took off my new clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress carrying itto speak the truthmuch more at my ease too though I had the bundle to carry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2275,2442,NA,And now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had run out fast and were gone and tomorrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2444,2590,NA,As the six evenings had dwindled away to five to four to three to two I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2592,2710,NA,On this last evening I dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my splendour	 until bedtime
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2712,2821,NA,We had a hot supper on the occasion graced by the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2823,2896,NA,We were all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2898,3041,NA,I was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little handportmanteau and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3043,3191,NA,I am afraidsore afraidthat this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe if we went to the coach together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3193,3472,NA,I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement but when I went up to my little room on this last night I felt compelled to admit that it might be so and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3474,3483,NA,I did not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3485,3655,NA,All night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places instead of to London and having in the traces now dogs now cats now pigs now mennever horses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3657,3747,NA,Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3749,3859,NA,Then I got up and partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in taking it fell asleep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3861,4075,NA,Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although I did not sleep at the window an hour I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4077,4214,NA,But long after that and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready I wanted the resolution to go downstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4216,4385,NA,After all I remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until Biddy called to me that I was late
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4387,4433,NA,It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4435,4536,NA,I got up from the meal saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4538,4706,NA,I suppose I must be off and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed Biddy and threw my arms around Joes neck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4708,4759,NA,Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4761,4924,NA,The last I saw of them was when I presently heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4926,5079,NA,I stopped then to wave my hat and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head crying huskily Hooroar and Biddy put her apron to her face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5081,5297,NA,I walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the High Street
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5299,5335,NA,I whistled and made nothing of going
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5337,5601,NA,But the village was very peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to show me the world and I had been so innocent and little there and all beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5603,5728,NA,It was by the fingerpost at the end of the village and I laid my hand upon it and said Goodbye O my dear dear friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5730,5858,NA,Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5860,5961,NA,I was better after I had cried than beforemore sorry more aware of my own ingratitude more gentle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5963,6020,NA,If I had cried before I should have had Joe with me then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6022,6336,NA,So subdued I was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk that when I was on the coach and it was clear of the town I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at home and a better parting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6338,6499,NA,We changed and I had not made up my mind and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back when we changed again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6501,6671,NA,And while I was occupied with these deliberations I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat highAs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6673,6702,NA,if he could possibly be there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6704,6798,NA,We changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to go back and I went on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6800,6876,NA,And the mists had all solemnly risen now and the world lay spread before me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6878,6934,NA,This is the end of the first stage of Pips expectations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6936,6946,NA,Chapter XX
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6948,7025,NA,The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7027,7208,NA,It was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by which I was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys Wood Street Cheapside London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7210,7500,NA,We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything otherwise while I was scared by the immensity of London I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and dirty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7502,7664,NA,Mr Jaggers had duly sent me his address it was Little Britain and he had written after it on his card just out of Smithfield and close by the coachoffice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7666,7910,NA,Nevertheless a hackneycoachman who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7912,8072,NA,His getting on his box which I remember to have been decorated with an old weatherstained peagreen hammercloth motheaten into rags was quite a work of time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8074,8293,NA,It was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged things behind for I dont know how many footmen to hold on by and a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8295,8557,NA,I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a strawyard it was and yet how like a ragshop and to wonder why the horses nosebags were kept inside when I observed the coachman beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8559,8666,NA,And stop we presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open door whereon was painted MR
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8668,8675,NA,JAGGERS
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8677,8687,NA,How much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8689,8709,NA,I asked the coachman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8711,8778,NA,The coachman answered A shillingunless you wish to make it more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8780,8826,NA,I naturally said I had no wish to make it more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8828,8879,NA,Then it must be a shilling observed the coachman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8881,8914,NA,I dont want to get into trouble
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8917,8931,NA,I  know  him 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8933,8998,NA,He darkly closed an eye at Mr Jaggerss name and shook his head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9000,9278,NA,When he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his mind I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked Was Mr Jaggers at home He is not returned the clerk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9280,9306,NA,He is in Court at present
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9308,9332,NA,Am I addressing Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9334,9376,NA,I signified that he was addressing Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9378,9381,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9383,9428,NA,Jaggers left word would you wait in his room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9430,9484,NA,He couldnt say how long he might be having a case on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9486,9577,NA,But it stands to reason his time being valuable that he wont be longer than he can help
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9579,9670,NA,With those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9672,9839,NA,Here we found a gentleman with one eye in a velveteen suit and kneebreeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9841,9884,NA,Go and wait outside Mike said the clerk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9886,10001,NA,I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,75,NA,y as I ever saw used and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,77,319,NA,Mr Jaggerss room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal place the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,321,657,NA,There were not so many papers about as I should have expected to see and there were some odd objects about that I should not have expected to seesuch as an old rusty pistol a sword in a scabbard several strangelooking boxes and packages and two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly swollen and twitchy about the nose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,659,865,NA,Mr Jaggerss own highbacked chair was of deadly black horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at the clients
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,867,1047,NA,The room was but small and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall the wall especially opposite to Mr Jaggerss chair being greasy with shoulders
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1049,1183,NA,I recalled too that the oneeyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1185,1318,NA,I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr Jaggerss chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1320,1441,NA,I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody elses disadvantage as his master had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1443,1588,NA,I wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1590,1681,NA,I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1683,1953,NA,I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr Jaggerss family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such illlooking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1955,2127,NA,Of course I had no experience of a London summer day and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2129,2297,NA,But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr Jaggerss close room until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr Jaggerss chair and got up and went out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2299,2443,NA,When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2445,2573,NA,So I came into Smithfield and the shameful place being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2575,2782,NA,So I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Pauls bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2784,3031,NA,Following the wall of the jail I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles and from this and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer I inferred that the trials were on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3033,3446,NA,While I looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robesmentioning that awful personage like waxwork and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3448,3907,NA,As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the Debtors Door out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on em would come out at that door the day after tomorrow at eight in the morning to be killed in a row
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3909,4247,NA,This was horrible and gave me a sickening idea of London the more so as the Lord Chief Justices proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pockethandkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally and which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4249,4322,NA,Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4324,4437,NA,I dropped into the office to ask if Mr Jaggers had come in yet and I found he had not and I strolled out again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4439,4609,NA,This time I made the tour of Little Britain and turned into Bartholomew Close and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr Jaggers as well as I
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4611,4879,NA,There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when they first passed me that Jaggers would do it if it was to be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4881,5146,NA,There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders Jaggers is for him Melia and what more  could  you have
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5148,5536,NA,There was a redeyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand and while the messenger was gone I remarked this Jew who was of a highly excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamppost and accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the words O Jaggerth Jaggerth Jaggerth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5538,5585,NA,all otherth ith CagMaggerth give me Jaggerth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5587,5709,NA,These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me and I admired and wondered more than ever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5711,5853,NA,At length as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain I saw Mr Jaggers coming across the road towards me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5855,5946,NA,All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there was quite a rush at him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5948,6086,NA,Mr Jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed himself to his followers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6088,6121,NA,First he took the two secret men
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6123,6207,NA,Now I have nothing to say to  you  said Mr Jaggers throwing his finger at them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6209,6244,NA,I want to know no more than I know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6246,6278,NA,As to the result its a tossup
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6280,6322,NA,I told you from the first it was a tossup
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6324,6467,NA,Have you paid Wemmick We made the money up this morning sir said one of the men submissively while the other perused Mr Jaggerss face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6469,6549,NA,I dont ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it up at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6551,6570,NA,Has Wemmick got it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6572,6610,NA,Yes sir said both the men together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6612,6639,NA,Very well then you may go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6641,6727,NA,Now I wont have it said Mr Jaggers waving his hand at them to put them behind him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6729,6778,NA,If you say a word to me Ill throw up the case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6780,6848,NA,We thought Mr Jaggers one of the men began pulling off his hat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6850,6902,NA,Thats what I told you not to do said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6904,6918,NA, You  thought
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6920,6958,NA,I think for you thats enough for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6960,7028,NA,If I want you I know where to find you I dont want you to find me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7030,7049,NA,Now I wont have it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7051,7071,NA,I wont hear a word
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7073,7190,NA,The two men looked at one another as Mr Jaggers waved them behind again and humbly fell back and were heard no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7192,7341,NA,And now  you  said Mr Jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on the two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly separatedOh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7343,7357,NA,Amelia is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7359,7377,NA,Yes Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7379,7483,NA,And do you remember retorted Mr Jaggers that but for me you wouldnt be here and couldnt be here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7485,7528,NA,O yes sir exclaimed both women together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7530,7621,NA,Lord bless you sir well we knows that Then why said Mr Jaggers do you come here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7623,7663,NA,My Bill sir the crying woman pleaded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7665,7705,NA,Now I tell you what said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7707,7720,NA,Once for all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7722,7781,NA,If you dont know that your Bills in good hands I know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7783,7914,NA,And if you come here bothering about your Bill Ill make an example of both your Bill and you and let him slip through my fingers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7916,7951,NA,Have you paid Wemmick O yes sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7953,7966,NA,Every farden

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8023,8099,NA,Say another wordone single wordand Wemmick shall give you your money back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8101,8166,NA,This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8168,8292,NA,No one remained now but the excitable Jew who had already raised the skirts of Mr Jaggerss coat to his lips several times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8294,8425,NA,I dont know this man said Mr Jaggers in the same devastating strain What does this fellow want Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9347,9472,NA,Without further interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9474,9576,NA,Heres Mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and approaching Mr Jaggers confidentially
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9578,9771,NA,Oh said Mr Jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bellrope your man comes on this afternoon

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,70,NA,iping his nose on his fur cap this time in a general way anythink
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,72,110,NA,Mr Jaggers suddenly became most irate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,112,277,NA,Now I warned you before said he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here Id make an example of you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,279,329,NA,You infernal scoundrel how dare you tell ME that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,331,419,NA,The client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious what he had done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,421,496,NA,Spooney said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his elbow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,498,912,NA,Soft Head Need you say it face to face Now I ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear Mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face and slowly replied Ayther to character or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,914,930,NA,Now be careful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,932,968,NA,In what station of life is this man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,970,1208,NA,Mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before beginning to reply in a nervous manner Weve dressed him up like when my guardian blustered out What
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1210,1229,NA,You WILL will you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1231,1241,NA,Spooney
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1243,1284,NA,added the clerk again with another stir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1286,1394,NA,After some helpless casting about Mike brightened and began again He is dressed like a spectable pieman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1396,1420,NA,A sort of a pastrycook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1422,1434,NA,Is he here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1436,1453,NA,asked my guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1455,1526,NA,I left him said Mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1528,1575,NA,Take him past that window and let me see him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1577,1619,NA,The window indicated was the office window
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1621,1817,NA,We all three went to it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner with a murderouslooking tall individual in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1819,1949,NA,This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery which was painted over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1951,2109,NA,Tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2111,2337,NA,My guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched standing from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he had made for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2339,2599,NA,I was to go to Barnards Inn to young Mr Pockets rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation I was to remain with young Mr Pocket until Monday on Monday I was to go with him to his fathers house on a visit that I might try how I liked it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2601,2858,NA,Also I was told what my allowance was to beit was a very liberal oneand had handed to me from one of my guardians drawers the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes and such other things as I could in reason want
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2860,3117,NA,You will find your credit good Mr Pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but I shall by this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3119,3182,NA,Of course youll go wrong somehow but thats no fault of mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3184,3294,NA,After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment I asked Mr Jaggers if I could send for a coach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3296,3405,NA,He said it was not worth while I was so near my destination Wemmick should walk round with me if I pleased
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3407,3463,NA,I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3465,3618,NA,Another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and I accompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3620,3859,NA,We found a new set of people lingering outside but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively I tell you its no use he wont have a word to say to one of you and we soon got clear of them and went on side by side
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3861,3872,NA,Chapter XXI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3874,4134,NA,Casting my eyes on Mr Wemmick as we went along to see what he was like in the light of day I found him to be a dry man rather short in stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dulledged chisel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4136,4289,NA,There were some marks in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4291,4433,NA,The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4435,4692,NA,I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements for he wore at least four mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4694,4827,NA,I noticed too that several rings and seals hung at his watchchain as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4829,4903,NA,He had glittering eyessmall keen and blackand thin wide mottled lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4905,4973,NA,He had had them to the best of my belief from forty to fifty years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4975,5035,NA,So you were never in London before said Mr Wemmick to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5037,5092,NA,No said I  I  was new here once said Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5094,5154,NA,Rum to think of now You are well acquainted with it now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5156,5184,NA,Why yes said Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5186,5210,NA,I know the moves of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5212,5239,NA,Is it a very wicked place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5241,5308,NA,I asked more for the sake of saying something than for information
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5310,5362,NA,You may get cheated robbed and murdered in London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5364,5428,NA,But there are plenty of people anywhere wholl do that for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5430,5509,NA,If there is bad blood between you and them said I to soften it off a little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5511,5513,NA,O
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5515,5601,NA,I dont know about bad blood returned Mr Wemmick theres not much bad blood about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5603,5654,NA,Theyll do it if theres anything to be got by it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5656,5677,NA,That makes it worse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5679,5715,NA,You think so returned Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5717,5752,NA,Much about the same I should say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5754,5921,NA,He wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him walking in a selfcontained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5923,6013,NA,His mouth was such a postoffice of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6015,6145,NA,We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance and that he was not smiling at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6147,6191,NA,Do you know where Mr Matthew Pocket lives
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6193,6212,NA,I asked Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6214,6254,NA,Yes said he nodding in the direction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6256,6288,NA,At Hammersmith west of London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6290,6310,NA,Is that far Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6312,6327,NA,Say five miles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6329,6346,NA,Do you know him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6348,6441,NA,Why youre a regular crossexaminer said Mr Wemmick looking at me with an approving air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6443,6459,NA,Yes I know him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6462,6474,NA,I  know him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6476,6729,NA,There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text when he said here we were at Barnards Inn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6731,6918,NA,My depression was not alleviated by the announcement for I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr Barnard to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere publichouse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6920,7108,NA,Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tomcats
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7110,7277,NA,We entered this haven through a wicketgate and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat buryingground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7279,7460,NA,I thought it had the most dismal trees in it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that I had ever seen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7462,7932,NA,I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled flowerpot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift while To Let To Let To Let glared at me from empty rooms as if no new wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7934,8111,NA,A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard and it had strewn ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dusthole
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8113,8387,NA,Thus far my sense of sight while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellarrot of rat and mouse and bug and coachingstables near at hand besidesaddressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned Try Barnards Mixture
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8389,8500,NA,So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great expectations that I looked in dismay at Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8502,8573,NA,Ah said he mistaking me the retirement reminds you of the country
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8575,8589,NA,So it does me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8591,8879,NA,He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairswhich appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming downto a set of chambers on the top floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8881,8883,NA,MR
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8885,8981,NA,POCKET JUN was painted on the door and there was a label on the letterbox Return shortly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8983,9044,NA,He hardly thought youd come so soon Mr Wemmick explained
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9046,9074,NA,You dont want me any more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9076,9184,NA,No thank you said I As I keep the cash Mr Wemmick observed we shall most likely meet pretty often
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9186,9207,NA,Good day Good day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9209,9301,NA,I put out my hand and Mr Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9303,9367,NA,Then he looked at me and said correcting himself To be sure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9369,9372,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9374,9411,NA,Youre in the habit of shaking hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9413,9557,NA,I was rather confused thinking it must be out of the London fashion but said yes I have got so out of it said Mr Wemmickexcept at last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9559,9605,NA,Very glad Im sure to make your acquaintance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9607,9616,NA,Good day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9618,9790,NA,When we had shaken hands and he was gone I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it came down like the guillotine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9792,9846,NA,Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9848,10001,NA,After this escape I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the windows encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully looking out saying to mysel

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,39,NA,lf that London was decidedly overrated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,41,293,NA,Mr Pocket Juniors idea of Shortly was not mine for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window before I heard footsteps on the stairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,295,428,NA,Gradually there arose before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a member of society of about my own standing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,430,527,NA,He had a paperbag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of breath
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,529,532,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,534,552,NA,Pip said he Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,554,594,NA,Pocket said I Dear me he exclaimed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,596,729,NA,I am extremely sorry but I knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday and I thought you would come by that one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,731,940,NA,The fact is I have been out on your accountnot that that is any excusefor I thought coming from the country you might like a little fruit after dinner and I went to Covent Garden Market to get it good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,942,1014,NA,For a reason that I had I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1016,1094,NA,I acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think this was a dream
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1096,1130,NA,Dear me said Mr Pocket Junior
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1132,1153,NA,This door sticks so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1155,1300,NA,As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paperbags were under his arms I begged him to allow me to hold them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1302,1401,NA,He relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1403,1531,NA,It yielded so suddenly at last that he staggered back upon me and I staggered back upon the opposite door and we both laughed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1533,1621,NA,But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head and as if this must be a dream
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1623,1662,NA,Pray come in said Mr Pocket Junior
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1664,1689,NA,Allow me to lead the way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1691,1778,NA,I am rather bare here but I hope youll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1780,1913,NA,My father thought you would get on more agreeably through tomorrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk about London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1915,1968,NA,I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1970,2160,NA,As to our table you wont find that bad I hope for it will be supplied from our coffeehouse here and it is only right I should add at your expense such being Mr Jaggerss directions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2162,2340,NA,As to our lodging its not by any means splendid because I have my own bread to earn and my father hasnt anything to give me and I shouldnt be willing to take it if he had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2342,2459,NA,This is our sittingroomjust such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth you see as they could spare from home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2461,2578,NA,You mustnt give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come for you from the coffeehouse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2580,2645,NA,This is my little bedroom rather musty but Barnards  is  musty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2647,2798,NA,This is your bedroom the furnitures hired for the occasion but I trust it will answer the purpose if you should want anything Ill go and fetch it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2800,2889,NA,The chambers are retired and we shall be alone together but we shant fight I dare say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2891,2961,NA,But dear me I beg your pardon youre holding the fruit all this time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2963,2999,NA,Pray let me take these bags from you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3001,3020,NA,I am quite ashamed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3022,3299,NA,As I stood opposite to Mr Pocket Junior delivering him the bags One Two I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine and he said falling back Lord bless me youre the prowling boy And you said I are the pale young gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3301,3313,NA,Chapter XXII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3315,3428,NA,The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnards Inn until we both burst out laughing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3430,3569,NA,The idea of its being you said he The idea of its being  you  said I And then we contemplated one another afresh and laughed again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3571,3764,NA,Well said the pale young gentleman reaching out his hand goodhumouredly its all over now I hope and it will be magnanimous in you if youll forgive me for having knocked you about so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3766,3923,NA,I derived from this speech that Mr Herbert Pocket for Herbert was the pale young gentlemans name still rather confounded his intention with his execution
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3925,3977,NA,But I made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3979,4053,NA,You hadnt come into your good fortune at that time said Herbert Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4055,4126,NA,No said I No he acquiesced I heard it had happened very lately
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4129,4180,NA,I  was rather on the lookout for good fortune then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4182,4196,NA,Indeed Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4198,4267,NA,Miss Havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4269,4313,NA,But she couldntat all events she didnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4315,4378,NA,I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4380,4428,NA,Bad taste said Herbert laughing but a fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4430,4634,NA,Yes she had sent for me on a trial visit and if I had come out of it successfully I suppose I should have been provided for perhaps I should have been whatyoumaycalled it to Estella Whats that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4636,4664,NA,I asked with sudden gravity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4666,4806,NA,He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4808,4860,NA,Affianced he explained still busy with the fruit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4862,4872,NA,Betrothed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4874,4881,NA,Engaged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4883,4899,NA,Whatshisnamed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4901,4923,NA,Any word of that sort
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4925,4963,NA,How did you bear your disappointment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4965,4972,NA,I asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4974,5017,NA,Pooh said he I didnt care much for it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5020,5036,NA,Shes  a Tartar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5038,5053,NA,Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5055,5099,NA,I dont say no to that but I meant Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5101,5284,NA,That girls hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex What relation is she to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5286,5317,NA,None said he Only adopted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5319,5368,NA,Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5370,5451,NA,What revenge Lord Mr Pip said he Dont you know No said I Dear me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5453,5508,NA,Its quite a story and shall be saved till dinnertime
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5510,5566,NA,And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5568,5601,NA,How did you come there that day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5603,5730,NA,I told him and he was attentive until I had finished and then burst out laughing again and asked me if I was sore afterwards
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5732,5819,NA,I didnt ask him if  he  was for my conviction on that point was perfectly established
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5821,5824,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5826,5877,NA,Jaggers is your guardian I understand he went on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5879,5884,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5886,5993,NA,You know he is Miss Havishams man of business and solicitor and has her confidence when nobody else has
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5995,6049,NA,This was bringing me I felt towards dangerous ground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6051,6295,NA,I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise that I had seen Mr Jaggers in Miss Havishams house on the very day of our combat but never at any other time and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6297,6397,NA,He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he called on my father to propose it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6399,6471,NA,Of course he knew about my father from his connection with Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6473,6691,NA,My father is Miss Havishams cousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6693,6871,NA,I had never seen any one then and I have never seen any one since who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6873,7029,NA,There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7031,7056,NA,I dont know how this was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7058,7176,NA,I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner but I cannot define by what means
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7178,7352,NA,He was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem indicative of natural strength
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7354,7451,NA,He had not a handsome face but it was better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7453,7607,NA,His figure was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and young
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7609,7813,NA,Whether Mr Trabbs local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me may be a question but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7815,7917,NA,As he was so communicative I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7919,8026,NA,I therefore told him my small story and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8028,8272,NA,I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place and knew very little of the ways of politeness I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8274,8361,NA,With pleasure said he though I venture to prophesy that youll want very few hints
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8363,8463,NA,I dare say we shall be often together and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8465,8549,NA,Will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8551,8581,NA,I thanked him and said I would
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8583,8643,NA,I informed him in exchange that my Christian name was Philip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8645,9014,NA,I dont take to Philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spellingbook who was so lazy that he fell into a pond or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eyes or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a birdsnesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighbourhood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9016,9045,NA,I tell you what I should like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9047,9119,NA,We are so harmonious and you have been a blacksmithwould you mind it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9121,9207,NA,I shouldnt mind anything that you propose I answered but I dont understand you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9209,9251,NA,Would you mind Handel for a familiar name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9253,9361,NA,Theres a charming piece of music by Handel called the Harmonious Blacksmith I should like it very much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9363,9543,NA,Then my dear Handel said he turning round as the door opened here is the dinner and I must beg of you to take the top of the table because the dinner is of your providing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9545,9606,NA,This I would not hear of so he took the top and I faced him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9608,9824,NA,It was a nice little dinnerseemed to me then a very Lord Mayors Feastand it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances with no old people by and with London all around us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9826,10001,NA,This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off for while the table was as Mr Pumblechook might have said the lap of luxurybeing entirely

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,491,NA,furnished forth from the coffeehousethe circumjacent region of sittingroom was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he fell over them the melted butter in the armchair the bread on the bookshelves the cheese in the coalscuttle and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next roomwhere I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,493,605,NA,All this made the feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my pleasure was without alloy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,607,717,NA,We had made some progress in the dinner when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,719,737,NA,True he replied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,739,762,NA,Ill redeem it at once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,764,993,NA,Let me introduce the topic Handel by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouthfor fear of accidentsand that while the fork is reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,995,1070,NA,It is scarcely worth mentioning only its as well to do as other people do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1072,1130,NA,Also the spoon is not generally used overhand but under
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1132,1155,NA,This has two advantages
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1157,1311,NA,You get at your mouth better which after all is the object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on the part of the right elbow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1313,1416,NA,He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1418,1462,NA,Now he pursued concerning Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1464,1512,NA,Miss Havisham you must know was a spoilt child
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1514,1584,NA,Her mother died when she was a baby and her father denied her nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1586,1669,NA,Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world and was a brewer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1671,1849,NA,I dont know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was and brew
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1851,1872,NA,You see it every day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1874,2017,NA,Yet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse may he said I Not on any account returned Herbert but a publichouse may keep a gentleman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2019,2023,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2025,2066,NA,Mr Havisham was very rich and very proud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2068,2088,NA,So was his daughter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2090,2123,NA,Miss Havisham was an only child
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2125,2135,NA,I hazarded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2137,2172,NA,Stop a moment I am coming to that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2174,2227,NA,No she was not an only child she had a halfbrother
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2229,2289,NA,Her father privately married againhis cook I rather think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2291,2351,NA,I thought he was proud said I My good Handel so he was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2353,2445,NA,He married his second wife privately because he was proud and in course of time  she  died
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2447,2614,NA,When she was dead I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are acquainted with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2616,2706,NA,As the son grew a young man he turned out riotous extravagant undutifulaltogether bad
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2708,2854,NA,At last his father disinherited him but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though not nearly so well off as Miss HavishamTake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2856,3060,NA,another glass of wine and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying ones glass as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on ones nose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3062,3125,NA,I had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3127,3156,NA,I thanked him and apologised
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3158,3192,NA,He said Not at all and resumed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3194,3282,NA,Miss Havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after as a great match
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3284,3406,NA,Her halfbrother had now ample means again but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3408,3622,NA,There were stronger differences between him and her than there had been between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the fathers anger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3624,3763,NA,Now I come to the cruel part of the storymerely breaking off my dear Handel to remark that a dinnernapkin will not go into a tumbler
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3765,3837,NA,Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler I am wholly unable to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3839,3993,NA,I only know that I found myself with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3995,4113,NA,Again I thanked him and apologised and again he said in the cheerfullest manner Not at all I am sure and resumed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4115,4256,NA,There appeared upon the scenesay at the races or the public balls or anywhere else you likea certain man who made love to Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4258,4447,NA,I never saw him for this happened fiveandtwenty years ago before you and I were Handel but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4449,4713,NA,But that he was not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my father most strongly asseverates because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world began a true gentleman in manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4715,4843,NA,He says no varnish can hide the grain of the wood and that the more varnish you put on the more the grain will express itself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4845,4849,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4851,4925,NA,This man pursued Miss Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4927,5088,NA,I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then and she passionately loved him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5090,5139,NA,There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5141,5444,NA,He practised on her affection in that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5446,5579,NA,Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havishams counsels and she was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5581,5703,NA,Her relations were poor and scheming with the exception of my father he was poor enough but not timeserving or jealous
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5705,5851,NA,The only independent one among them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5853,5988,NA,She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his presence and my father has never seen her since
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5990,6416,NA,I thought of her having said Matthew will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her Its not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would look trueeven to himand even to her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6418,6461,NA,To return to the man and make an end of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6463,6589,NA,The marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were invited
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6591,6627,NA,The day came but not the bridegroom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6629,6727,NA,He wrote her a letter Which she received I struck in when she was dressing for her marriage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6729,6853,NA,At twenty minutes to nine At the hour and minute said Herbert nodding at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6855,6971,NA,What was in it further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off I cant tell you because I dont know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6973,7156,NA,When she recovered from a bad illness that she had she laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since looked upon the light of day Is that all the story
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7158,7187,NA,I asked after considering it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7189,7434,NA,All I know of it and indeed I only know so much through piecing it out for myself for my father always avoids it and even when Miss Havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7436,7466,NA,But I have forgotten one thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7468,7667,NA,It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her halfbrother that it was a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7669,7861,NA,I wonder he didnt marry her and get all the property said I He may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her halfbrothers scheme said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7863,7868,NA,Mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7870,7888,NA,I dont know that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7890,7918,NA,What became of the two men
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7920,7964,NA,I asked after again considering the subject
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7966,8043,NA,They fell into deeper shame and degradationif there can be deeperand ruin
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8045,8081,NA,Are they alive now I dont know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8083,8160,NA,You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham but adopted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8162,8207,NA,When adopted Herbert shrugged his shoulders
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8209,8281,NA,There has always been an Estella since I have heard of a Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8283,8297,NA,I know no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8299,8420,NA,And now Handel said he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly open understanding between us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8422,8468,NA,All that I know about Miss Havisham you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8470,8515,NA,And all that I know I retorted you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8517,8536,NA,I fully believe it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8538,8601,NA,So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8603,8855,NA,And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in lifenamely that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe ityou may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8857,9013,NA,In truth he said this with so much delicacy that I felt the subject done with even though I should be under his fathers roof for years and years to come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9015,9164,NA,Yet he said it with so much meaning too that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress as I understood the fact myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9166,9386,NA,It had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it that I now perceived this to be the case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9388,9478,NA,We were very gay and sociable and I asked him in the course of conversation what he was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9480,9527,NA,He replied A capitalistan Insurer of Ships
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9529,9650,NA,I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping or capital for he added In the City
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9652,9872,NA,I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible head open
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9874,9997,NA,But again there came upon me for my relief that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,77,NA,shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,79,153,NA,I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares and cut into the Direction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,155,197,NA,I shall also do a little in the mining way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,199,291,NA,None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,293,432,NA,I think I shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to the East Indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious woods
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,434,460,NA,Its an interesting trade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,462,520,NA,And the profits are large said I Tremendous said he
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,522,600,NA,I wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than my own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,602,751,NA,Illustration I think I shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets to the West Indies for sugar tobacco and rum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,753,801,NA,Also to Ceylon especially for elephants tusks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,803,1045,NA,You will want a good many ships said I A perfect fleet said he Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present I havent begun insuring yet he replied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1047,1070,NA,I am looking about me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1072,1135,NA,Somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnards Inn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1137,1183,NA,I said in a tone of conviction Ahh Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1185,1266,NA,I am in a countinghouse and looking about me Is a countinghouse profitable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1268,1275,NA,I asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1277,1345,NA,Todo you mean to the young fellow whos in it he asked in reply
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1347,1384,NA,Yes to you Why nno not to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1386,1464,NA,He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1466,1490,NA,Not directly profitable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1492,1555,NA,That is it doesnt pay me anything and I have tokeep myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1557,1736,NA,This certainly had not a profitable appearance and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1738,1803,NA,But the thing is said Herbert Pocket that you look about you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1806,1829,NA,Thats  the grand thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1831,1893,NA,You are in a countinghouse you know and you look about you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1895,2051,NA,It struck me as a singular implication that you couldnt be out of a countinghouse you know and look about you but I silently deferred to his experience
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2053,2116,NA,Then the time comes said Herbert when you see your opening
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2118,2204,NA,And you go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there you are
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2206,2281,NA,When you have once made your capital you have nothing to do but employ it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2283,2363,NA,This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden very like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2365,2462,NA,His manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2464,2567,NA,It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2569,2766,NA,It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2768,2908,NA,Yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2910,2991,NA,It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways and we got on famously
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2993,3245,NA,In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets and went halfprice to the Theatre and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks and I wondered who shod all the horses there and wished Joe did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3247,3337,NA,On a moderate computation it was many months that Sunday since I had left Joe and Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3339,3448,NA,The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3450,3643,NA,That I could have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes on the very last Sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities geographical and social solar and lunar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3645,4010,NA,Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of night the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnards Inn under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4012,4171,NA,On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine Herbert went to the countinghouse to report himselfto look about him too I supposeand I bore him company
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4173,4271,NA,He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith and I was to wait about for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4273,4489,NA,It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4491,4735,NA,Nor did the countinghouse where Herbert assisted show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second floor rather than a look out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4737,4963,NA,I waited about until it was noon and I went upon Change and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom I took to be great merchants though I couldnt understand why they should all be out of spirits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4965,5276,NA,When Herbert came we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe and where I could not help noticing even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters clothes than in the steaks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5278,5474,NA,This collation disposed of at a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we went back to Barnards Inn and got my little portmanteau and then took coach for Hammersmith
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5476,5588,NA,We arrived there at two or three oclock in the afternoon and had very little way to walk to Mr Pockets house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5590,5726,NA,Lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river where Mr Pockets children were playing about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5728,5936,NA,And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned I saw that Mr and Mrs Pockets children were not growing up or being brought up but were tumbling up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5938,6127,NA,Mrs Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with her legs upon another garden chair and Mrs Pockets two nursemaids were looking about them while the children played
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6129,6175,NA,Mamma said Herbert this is young Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6177,6249,NA,Upon which Mrs Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6251,6452,NA,Master Alick and Miss Jane cried one of the nurses to two of the children if you go a bouncing up against them bushes youll fall over into the river and be drownded and whatll your pa say then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6454,6704,NA,At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs Pockets handkerchief and said If that dont make six times youve dropped it Mum Upon which Mrs Pocket laughed and said Thank you Flopson and settling herself in one chair only resumed her book
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6706,6935,NA,Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eyes upon me and said I hope your mamma is quite well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6937,7224,NA,This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7226,7312,NA,Well she cried picking up the pockethandkerchief if that dont make seven times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7314,7580,NA,What ARE you adoing of this afternoon Mum Mrs Pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of recognition and said Thank you Flopson and forgot me and went on reading
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7582,7714,NA,I found now I had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present in various stages of tumbling up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7716,7820,NA,I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region of air wailing dolefully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7822,7896,NA,If there aint Baby said Flopson appearing to think it most surprising
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7898,7922,NA,Make haste up Millers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7924,8104,NA,Millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees the childs wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8106,8185,NA,Mrs Pocket read all the time and I was curious to know what the book could be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8187,8570,NA,We were waiting I supposed for Mr Pocket to come out to us at any rate we waited there and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs Pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over heralways very much to her momentary astonishment and their own more enduring lamentation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8572,8928,NA,I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it until by and by Millers came down with the baby which baby was handed to Flopson which Flopson was handing it to Mrs Pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs Pocket baby and all and was caught by Herbert and myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8930,9029,NA,Gracious me Flopson said Mrs Pocket looking off her book for a moment everybodys tumbling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9031,9125,NA,Gracious you indeed Mum returned Flopson very red in the face what have you got there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9127,9169,NA, I  got here Flopson asked Mrs Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9171,9204,NA,Why if it aint your footstool
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9206,9219,NA,cried Flopson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9221,9292,NA,And if you keep it under your skirts like that whos to help tumbling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9294,9298,NA,Here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9300,9342,NA,Take the baby Mum and give me your book
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9344,9471,NA,Mrs Pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap while the other children played about it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9473,9606,NA,This had lasted but a very short time when Mrs Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9608,9755,NA,Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9757,10001,NA,Under these circumstances when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house like a little flock of sheep and Mr Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance I was not much surprised to find that Mr Pocket was a gentleman with a

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,154,NA,a rather perplexed expression of face and with his very grey hair disordered on his head as if he didnt quite see his way to putting anything straight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,156,169,NA,Chapter XXIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,171,249,NA,Mr Pocket said he was glad to see me and he hoped I was not sorry to see him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,251,330,NA,For I really am not he added with his sons smile an alarming personage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,332,448,NA,He was a younglooking man in spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair and his manner seemed quite natural
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,450,667,NA,I use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,669,855,NA,When he had talked with me a little he said to Mrs Pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were black and handsome Belinda I hope you have welcomed Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,857,905,NA,And she looked up from her book and said Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,907,1015,NA,She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind and asked me if I liked the taste of orangeflower water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1017,1216,NA,As the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone or subsequent transaction I consider it to have been thrown out like her previous approaches in general conversational condescension
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1218,1774,NA,I found out within a few hours and may mention at once that Mrs Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebodys determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motivesI forget whose if I ever knewthe Sovereigns the Prime Ministers the Lord Chancellors the Archbishop of Canterburys anybodysand had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1776,2061,NA,I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2063,2275,NA,Be that as it may he had directed Mrs Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2277,2450,NA,So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but perfectly helpless and useless
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2452,2688,NA,With her character thus happily formed in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr Pocket who was also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2690,2936,NA,As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time he and Mrs Pocket had taken Time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2938,3154,NA,The judicious parent having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle and had informed Mr Pocket that his wife was a treasure for a Prince
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3156,3306,NA,Mr Pocket had invested the Princes treasure in the ways of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3308,3525,NA,Still Mrs Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married a title while Mr Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach because he had never got one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3527,3694,NA,Mr Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a pleasant one and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sittingroom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3696,3818,NA,He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name Drummle and Startop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3820,3901,NA,Drummle an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of architecture was whistling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3903,4067,NA,Startop younger in years and appearance was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4069,4289,NA,Both Mr and Mrs Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody elses hands that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there until I found this unknown power to be the servants
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4291,4546,NA,It was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4548,4943,NA,They allowed a very liberal table to Mr and Mrs Pocket yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchenalways supposing the boarder capable of selfdefence for before I had been there a week a neighbouring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4945,5122,NA,This greatly distressed Mrs Pocket who burst into tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldnt mind their own business
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5124,5419,NA,By degrees I learnt and chiefly from Herbert that Mr Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge where he had distinguished himself but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs Pocket very early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5421,5693,NA,After grinding a number of dull bladesof whom it was remarkable that their fathers when influential were always going to help him to preferment but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstonehe had wearied of that poor work and had come to London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5695,6059,NA,Here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them and had refurbished divers others for special occasions and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction and on such means added to some very moderate private resources still maintained the house I saw
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6061,6268,NA,Mr and Mrs Pocket had a toady neighbour a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody and shed smiles and tears on everybody according to circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6270,6383,NA,This ladys name was Mrs Coiler and I had the honour of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6385,6555,NA,She gave me to understand on the stairs that it was a blow to dear Mrs Pocket that dear Mr Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6557,6752,NA,That did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence at that time I had known her something less than five minutes if they were all like Me it would be quite another thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6754,6988,NA,But dear Mrs Pocket said Mrs Coiler after her early disappointment not that dear Mr Pocket was to blame in that requires so much luxury and elegance Yes maam I said to stop her for I was afraid she was going to cry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6990,7095,NA,And she is of so aristocratic a disposition Yes maam I said again with the same object as before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7097,7214,NA,That it  is  hard said Mrs Coiler to have dear Mr Pockets time and attention diverted from dear Mrs Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7216,7437,NA,I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butchers time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs Pocket but I said nothing and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7439,7716,NA,It came to my knowledge through what passed between Mrs Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and other instruments of selfdestruction that Drummle whose Christian name was Bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7718,7932,NA,It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7934,8103,NA,Drummle didnt say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognised Mrs Pocket as a woman and a sister
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8105,8376,NA,No one but themselves and Mrs Coiler the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert but it promised to last a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8378,8431,NA,It was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8433,8688,NA,To my unutterable amazement I now for the first time saw Mr Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8690,8884,NA,He laid down the carvingknife and forkbeing engaged in carving at the momentput his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8886,8988,NA,When he had done this and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he was about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8990,9050,NA,Mrs Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9052,9150,NA,I liked it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9152,9510,NA,She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left which was altogether snaky and forktongued and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop who said very little to her or upon Drummle who said less I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9512,9666,NA,After dinner the children were introduced and Mrs Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes noses and legsa sagacious way of improving their minds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9668,9816,NA,There were four little girls and two little boys besides the baby who might have been either and the babys next successor who was as yet neither
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9818,10001,NA,They were brought in by Flopson and Millers much as though those two noncommissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these while Mrs Pocket loo

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,178,234,NA,Give me your fork Mum and take the baby said Flopson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,236,300,NA,Dont take it that way or youll get its head under the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,302,445,NA,Thus advised Mrs Pocket took it the other way and got its head upon the table which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,447,458,NA,Dear dear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,460,540,NA,Give it me back Mum said Flopson and Miss Jane come and dance to baby do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,542,757,NA,One of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and laughed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,759,922,NA,Then all the children laughed and Mr Pocket who in the meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair laughed and we all laughed and were glad
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,924,1022,NA,Flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll then got it safely into Mrs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1024,1267,NA,Pockets lap and gave it the nutcrackers to play with at the same time recommending Mrs Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1269,1457,NA,Then the two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gamingtable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1459,1732,NA,I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs Pockets falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the baby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1734,1888,NA,At length little Jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1890,2021,NA,Mrs Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time and not approving of this said to Jane You naughty child how dare you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2023,2052,NA,Go and sit down this instant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2054,2126,NA,Mamma dear lisped the little girl baby ood have put hith eyeth out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2128,2175,NA,How dare you tell me so retorted Mrs Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2177,2220,NA,Go and sit down in your chair this moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2222,2333,NA,Mrs Pockets dignity was so crushing that I felt quite abashed as if I myself had done something to rouse it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2335,2435,NA,Belinda remonstrated Mr Pocket from the other end of the table how can you be so unreasonable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2437,2485,NA,Jane only interfered for the protection of baby
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2487,2544,NA,I will not allow anybody to interfere said Mrs Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2546,2629,NA,I am surprised Matthew that you should expose me to the affront of interference
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2631,2699,NA,Good God cried Mr Pocket in an outbreak of desolate desperation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2701,2895,NA,Are infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs and is nobody to save them I will not be interfered with by Jane said Mrs Pocket with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2897,2940,NA,I hope I know my poor grandpapas position
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2942,2955,NA,Jane indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2957,3067,NA,Mr Pocket got his hands in his hair again and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3069,3121,NA,Hear this he helplessly exclaimed to the elements
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3123,3201,NA,Babies are to be nutcrackered dead for peoples poor grandpapas positions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3203,3252,NA,Then he let himself down again and became silent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3254,3319,NA,We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3321,3559,NA,A pause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane who appeared to me to be the only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had any decided acquaintance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3561,3564,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3566,3620,NA,Drummle said Mrs Pocket will you ring for Flopson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3622,3671,NA,Jane you undutiful little thing go and lie down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3673,3772,NA,Now baby darling come with ma The baby was the soul of honour and protested with all its might
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3774,3977,NA,It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs Pockets arm exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3979,4095,NA,And it gained its point after all for I saw it through the window within a few minutes being nursed by little Jane
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4097,4269,NA,It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinnertable through Flopsons having some private engagement and their not being anybody elses business
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4271,4390,NA,I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr Pocket which were exemplified in the following manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4392,4660,NA,Mr Pocket with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes as if he couldnt make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment and why they hadnt been billeted by Nature on somebody else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4662,4949,NA,Then in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questionsas why little Joe had that hole in his frill who said Pa Flopson was going to mend it when she had timeand how little Fanny came by that whitlow who said Pa Millers was going to poultice it when she didnt forget
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4951,5174,NA,Then he melted into parental tenderness and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as they went out with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5176,5220,NA,In the evening there was rowing on the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5222,5313,NA,As Drummle and Startop had each a boat I resolved to set up mine and to cut them both out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5315,5636,NA,I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thamesnot to say for other watersI at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prizewherry who plied at our stairs and to whom I was introduced by my new allies
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5638,5724,NA,This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5726,5827,NA,If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil I doubt if he would have paid it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5829,5980,NA,There was a suppertray after we got home at night and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5982,6175,NA,Mr Pocket was in good spirits when a housemaid came in and said If you please sir I should wish to speak to you Speak to your master said Mrs Pocket whose dignity was roused again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6177,6211,NA,How can you think of such a thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6213,6236,NA,Go and speak to Flopson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6238,6272,NA,Or speak to meat some other time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6274,6384,NA,Begging your pardon maam returned the housemaid I should wish to speak at once and to speak to master
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6386,6481,NA,Hereupon Mr Pocket went out of the room and we made the best of ourselves until he came back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6483,6595,NA,This is a pretty thing Belinda said Mr Pocket returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6597,6744,NA,Heres the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6746,6893,NA,Mrs Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion and said This is that odious Sophias doing What do you mean Belinda demanded Mr Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6895,6934,NA,Sophia has told you said Mrs Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6936,7245,NA,Did I not see her with my own eyes and hear her with my own ears come into the room just now and ask to speak to you But has she not taken me downstairs Belinda returned Mr Pocket and shown me the woman and the bundle too And do you defend her Matthew said Mrs Pocket for making mischief
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7247,7280,NA,Mr Pocket uttered a dismal groan
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7282,7361,NA,Am I grandpapas granddaughter to be nothing in the house said Mrs Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7363,7548,NA,Besides the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation that she felt I was born to be a Duchess
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7550,7652,NA,There was a sofa where Mr Pocket stood and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7654,7783,NA,Still in that attitude he said with a hollow voice Good night Mr Pip when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7785,7797,NA,Chapter XXIV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7799,8013,NA,After two or three days when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen Mr Pocket and I had a long talk together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8015,8308,NA,He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself for he referred to his having been told by Mr Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could hold my own with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8310,8366,NA,I acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8368,8557,NA,He advised my attending certain places in London for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8559,8701,NA,He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8703,9011,NA,Through his way of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9013,9184,NA,If he had shown indifference as a master I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no such excuse and each of us did the other justice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9186,9336,NA,Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about himor anything but what was serious honest and goodin his tutor communication with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9338,9600,NA,When these points were settled and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnards Inn my life would be agreeably varied while my manners would be none the worse for Herberts society
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9602,9746,NA,Mr Pocket did not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it it must be submitted to my guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9748,9919,NA,I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr Jaggers

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1257,1314,NA,Take Mr Pips written order and pay him twenty pounds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1316,1433,NA,This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me and that not of an agreeable kind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1435,1715,NA,Mr Jaggers never laughed but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising himself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to creak as if  they  laughed in a dry and suspicious way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1717,1860,NA,As he happened to go out now and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr Jaggerss manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1862,2076,NA,Tell him that and hell take it as a compliment answered Wemmick he dont mean that you  should  know what to make of itOh for I looked surprised its not personal its professional only professional
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2078,2244,NA,Wemmick was at his desk lunchingand crunchingon a dry hard biscuit pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as if he were posting them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2246,2330,NA,Always seems to me said Wemmick as if he had set a mantrap and was watching it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2332,2361,NA,Suddenlyclickyoure caught
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2363,2471,NA,Without remarking that mantraps were not among the amenities of life I said I supposed he was very skilful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2473,2509,NA,Deep said Wemmick as Australia
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2511,2681,NA,Pointing with his pen at the office floor to express that Australia was understood for the purposes of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2683,2769,NA,If there was anything deeper added Wemmick bringing his pen to paper hed be it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2771,2848,NA,Then I said I supposed he had a fine business and Wemmick said Capital
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2850,2888,NA,Then I asked if there were many clerks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2890,3018,NA,to which he replied We dont run much into clerks because theres only one Jaggers and people wont have him at second hand

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3130,3364,NA,When Mr Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post and had paid me my money from a cashbox in a safe the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coatcollar like an ironpigtail we went upstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3366,3534,NA,The house was dark and shabby and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr Jaggerss room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3536,3843,NA,In the front first floor a clerk who looked something between a publican and a ratcatchera large pale puffed swollen manwas attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr Jaggerss coffers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3845,3924,NA,Getting evidence together said Mr Wemmick as we came out for the Bailey
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3926,4329,NA,In the room over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes whom Mr Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt me anything I pleasedand who was in an excessive whiteperspiration as if he had been trying his art on himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4331,4611,NA,In a back room a highshouldered man with a faceache tied up in dirty flannel who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen for Mr Jaggerss own use
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4613,4643,NA,This was all the establishment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4645,4752,NA,When we went downstairs again Wemmick led me into my guardians room and said This youve seen already
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4754,4877,NA,Pray said I as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again whose likenesses are those
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4879,4993,NA,These said Wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4995,5025,NA,These are two celebrated ones
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5027,5079,NA,Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5322,5338,NA,Is it like him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5340,5441,NA,I asked recoiling from the brute as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5443,5452,NA,Like him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5454,5476,NA,Its himself you know

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5542,5614,NA,You had a particular fancy for me hadnt you Old Artful said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5616,5862,NA,He then explained this affectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying Had it made for me express Is the lady anybody said I No returned Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5864,5878,NA,Only his game
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5880,6130,NA,You liked your bit of game didnt you No deuce a bit of a lady in the case Mr Pip except oneand she wasnt of this slender ladylike sort and you wouldnt have caught  her  looking after this urn unless there was something to drink in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6132,6261,NA,Wemmicks attention being thus directed to his brooch he put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pockethandkerchief
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6263,6309,NA,Did that other creature come to the same end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6311,6318,NA,I asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6320,6342,NA,He has the same look
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6344,6396,NA,Youre right said Wemmick its the genuine look
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6398,6475,NA,Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6477,6547,NA,Yes he came to the same end quite the natural end here I assure you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6549,6639,NA,He forged wills this blade did if he didnt also put the supposed testators to sleep too

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6794,6986,NA,I never met such a liar as you Before putting his late friend on his shelf again Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said Sent out to buy it for me only the day before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6988,7146,NA,While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7148,7290,NA,As he had shown no diffidence on the subject I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before me dusting his hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7292,7347,NA,O yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8858,8968,NA,As I was taking my departure he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr Jaggers at it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8970,9107,NA,For several reasons and not least because I didnt clearly know what Mr Jaggers would be found to be at I replied in the affirmative
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9109,9490,NA,We dived into the City and came up in a crowded policecourt where a bloodrelation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches was standing at the bar uncomfortably chewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or crossexaminationI dont know whichand was striking her and the bench and everybody present with awe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9492,9610,NA,If anybody of whatsoever degree said a word that he didnt approve of he instantly required to have it taken down

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,344,514,NA,Bentley Drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,516,767,NA,Heavy in figure movement and comprehensionin the sluggish complexion of his face and in the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a roomhe was idle proud niggardly reserved and suspicious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,769,929,NA,He came of rich people down in Somersetshire who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,931,1073,NA,Thus Bentley Drummle had come to Mr Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1377,1693,NA,It was but natural that I should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle and that even in the earliest evenings of our boating he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another conversing from boat to boat while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1695,1986,NA,He would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the backwater when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in midstream
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1988,2032,NA,Herbert was my intimate companion and friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2034,2220,NA,I presented him with a halfshare in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often took me up to London

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2797,2881,NA,As a matter of course they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2883,3024,NA,Towards Mr Pocket as a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3026,3193,NA,Mrs Pocket they held in contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3287,3476,NA,I soon contracted expensive habits and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous but through good and evil I stuck to my books
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3478,3563,NA,There was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3565,3789,NA,Between Mr Pocket and Herbert I got on fast and with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted and clear obstructions out of my road I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3791,3926,NA,I had not seen Mr Wemmick for some weeks when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3928,4033,NA,He replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect me at the office at six oclock
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4035,4135,NA,Thither I went and there I found him putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4137,4228,NA,Did you think of walking down to Walworth said he Certainly said I if you approve

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6655,6731,NA,But  he  would have much said Wemmick cutting me short and they know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6733,6786,NA,Hed have their lives and the lives of scores of em
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6788,6814,NA,Hed have all he could get
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6816,6891,NA,And its impossible to say what he couldnt get if he gave his mind to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6893,7043,NA,I was falling into meditation on my guardians greatness when Wemmick remarked As to the absence of plate thats only his natural depth you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7045,7100,NA,A rivers its natural depth and hes his natural depth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7102,7125,NA,Look at his watchchain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7127,7146,NA,Thats real enough
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7148,7186,NA,Its very massive said I Massive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7188,7204,NA,repeated Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7206,7217,NA,I think so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7219,7300,NA,And his watch is a gold repeater and worth a hundred pound if its worth a penny
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7302,7564,NA,Mr Pip there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch theres not a man a woman or a child among them who wouldnt identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it was red hot if inveigled into touching it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7566,7786,NA,At first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature did Mr Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7788,7916,NA,It appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7918,8069,NA,Wemmicks house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8071,8099,NA,My own doing said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8101,8125,NA,Looks pretty dont it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8127,8316,NA,I highly commended it I think it was the smallest house I ever saw with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham and a gothic door almost too small to get in at
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8318,8404,NA,Thats a real flagstaff you see said Wemmick and on Sundays I run up a real flag
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8406,8420,NA,Then look here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8422,8503,NA,After I have crossed this bridge I hoist it upsoand cut off the communication
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8505,8585,NA,The bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8587,8738,NA,But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so with a relish and not merely mechanically
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8740,8815,NA,At nine oclock every night Greenwich time said Wemmick the gun fires
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8817,8837,NA,There he is you see
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8839,8899,NA,And when you hear him go I think youll say hes a Stinger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8901,8999,NA,The piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress constructed of latticework
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9001,9108,NA,It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9110,9348,NA,Then at the back said Wemmick out of sight so as not to impede the idea of fortificationsfor its a principle with me if you have an idea carry it out and keep it upI dont know whether thats your opinion I said decidedly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9350,9545,NA,At the back theres a pig and there are fowls and rabbits then I knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers and youll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9547,9733,NA,So sir said Wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9735,9947,NA,Then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9949,10001,NA,Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,32,337,NA,This piece of water with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,339,502,NA,I am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and my own gardener and my own Jack of all Trades said Wemmick in acknowledging my compliments
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,504,538,NA,Well its a good thing you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,540,597,NA,It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away and pleases the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,599,664,NA,You wouldnt mind being at once introduced to the Aged would you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,666,690,NA,It wouldnt put you out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,692,753,NA,I expressed the readiness I felt and we went into the castle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,755,892,NA,There we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat clean cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,894,1043,NA,Well aged parent said Wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way how am you All right John all right replied the old man

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1175,1324,NA,Nod away at him if you please like winking This is a fine place of my sons sir cried the old man while I nodded as hard as I possibly could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1326,1364,NA,This is a pretty pleasureground sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1366,1499,NA,This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation after my sons time for the peoples enjoyment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1501,1779,NA,Youre as proud of it as Punch aint you Aged said Wemmick contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened  theres  a nod for you giving him a tremendous one  theres  another for you giving him a still more tremendous one you like that dont you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1781,1874,NA,If youre not tired Mr Pipthough I know its tiring to strangerswill you tip him one more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1876,1911,NA,You cant think how it pleases him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1913,1967,NA,I tipped him several more and he was in great spirits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1969,2206,NA,We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in the arbour where Wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2208,2301,NA,Is it your own Mr Wemmick O yes said Wemmick I have got hold of it a bit at a time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2303,2345,NA,Its a freehold by George Is it indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2347,2377,NA,I hope Mr Jaggers admires it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2379,2408,NA,Never seen it said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2410,2428,NA,Never heard of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2430,2449,NA,Never seen the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2451,2469,NA,Never heard of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2471,2527,NA,No the office is one thing and private life is another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2529,2647,NA,When I go into the office I leave the Castle behind me and when I come into the Castle I leave the office behind me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2649,2727,NA,If its not in any way disagreeable to you youll oblige me by doing the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2729,2773,NA,I dont wish it professionally spoken about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2775,2847,NA,Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2849,2946,NA,The punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and talking until it was almost nine oclock
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2948,3041,NA,Getting near gunfire said Wemmick then as he laid down his pipe its the Ageds treat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3043,3201,NA,Proceeding into the Castle again we found the Aged heating the poker with expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3203,3344,NA,Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the redhot poker from the Aged and repair to the battery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3346,3536,NA,He took it and went out and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in it ring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3538,3681,NA,Upon this the Agedwho I believe would have been blown out of his armchair but for holding on by the elbowscried out exultingly Hes fired
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3683,3809,NA,I heerd him and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3811,3912,NA,The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3914,4245,NA,They were mostly of a felonious character comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several manuscript confessions written under condemnationupon which Mr Wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words every one of em Lies sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4247,4423,NA,These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum and some tobaccostoppers carved by the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4425,4725,NA,They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted and which served not only as the general sittingroom but as the kitchen too if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roastingjack
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4727,4807,NA,There was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the Aged in the day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4809,4927,NA,When she had laid the suppercloth the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4929,5145,NA,The supper was excellent and though the Castle was rather subject to dryrot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been farther off I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5147,5384,NA,Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when I lay down on my back in bed it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5386,5468,NA,Wemmick was up early in the morning and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5470,5614,NA,After that he fell to gardening and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged and nodding at him in a most devoted manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5616,5719,NA,Our breakfast was as good as the supper and at halfpast eight precisely we started for Little Britain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5721,5828,NA,By degrees Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened into a postoffice again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5830,6144,NA,At last when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coatcollar he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6146,6158,NA,Chapter XXVI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6160,6312,NA,It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardians establishment with that of his cashier and clerk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6314,6542,NA,My guardian was in his room washing his hands with his scented soap when I went into the office from Walworth and he called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6544,6614,NA,No ceremony he stipulated and no dinner dress and say tomorrow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6616,6830,NA,I asked him where we should come to for I had no idea where he lived and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied Come here and Ill take you home with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6832,6940,NA,I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or a dentist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6942,7052,NA,He had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumers shop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7054,7272,NA,It had an unusually large jacktowel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7274,7540,NA,When I and my friends repaired to him at six oclock next day he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hands but laving his face and gargling his throat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7542,7705,NA,And even when he had done all that and had gone all round the jacktowel he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7707,7965,NA,There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence that they gave it up for that day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7967,8207,NA,As we walked along westward he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but he never otherwise recognised anybody or took notice that anybody recognised him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8209,8293,NA,He conducted us to Gerrard Street Soho to a house on the south side of that street
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8295,8388,NA,Rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want of painting and with dirty windows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8390,8495,NA,He took out his key and opened the door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8497,8585,NA,So up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8587,8735,NA,There were carved garlands on the panelled walls and as he stood among them giving us welcome I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8737,8837,NA,Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms the second was his dressingroom the third his bedroom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8839,8918,NA,He told us that he held the whole house but rarely used more of it than we saw
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8920,9128,NA,The table was comfortably laidno silver in the service of courseand at the side of his chair was a capacious dumbwaiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on it and four dishes of fruit for dessert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9130,9230,NA,I noticed throughout that he kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9232,9409,NA,There was a bookcase in the room I saw from the backs of the books that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials acts of Parliament and such things
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9411,9474,NA,The furniture was all very solid and good like his watchchain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9476,9560,NA,It had an official look however and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9562,9746,NA,In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9748,9922,NA,As he had scarcely seen my three companions until nowfor he and I had walked togetherhe stood on the hearthrug after ringing the bell and took a searching look at them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9924,10001,NA,To my surprise he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested i

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,130,207,NA,Whos the Spider The spider said I The blotchy sprawly sulky fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,209,289,NA,Thats Bentley Drummle I replied the one with the delicate face is Startop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,291,405,NA,Not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he returned Bentley Drummle is his name is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,407,438,NA,I like the look of that fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,440,601,NA,He immediately began to talk to Drummle not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,603,715,NA,I was looking at the two when there came between me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,717,808,NA,She was a woman of about forty I supposedbut I may have thought her younger than she was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,810,920,NA,Rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely pale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,922,1313,NA,I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches caldron
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1315,1434,NA,She set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1436,1553,NA,We took our seats at the round table and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him while Startop sat on the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1555,1709,NA,It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1711,1905,NA,Sauces wines all the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our host from his dumbwaiter and when they had made the circuit of the table he always put them back again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1907,2056,NA,Similarly he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2058,2106,NA,No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2108,2193,NA,She set on every dish and I always saw in her face a face rising out of the caldron
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2195,2406,NA,Years afterwards I made a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2408,2811,NA,Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmicks preparation I observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2813,2929,NA,I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a purpose of always holding her in suspense
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2931,3098,NA,Dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3100,3284,NA,For myself I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronise Herbert and to boast of my great prospects before I quite knew that I had opened my lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3286,3490,NA,It was so with all of us but with no one more than Drummle the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3492,3691,NA,It was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3693,3882,NA,Drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3884,4132,NA,By some invisible agency my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4134,4409,NA,Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle that to me was quite inexplicable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4411,4518,NA,Suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeepers like a trap as she stretched it across the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4520,4605,NA,So suddenly and smartly did he do this that we all stopped in our foolish contention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4607,4676,NA,If you talk of strength said Mr Jaggers  I ll show you a wrist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4678,4709,NA,Molly let them see your wrist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4711,4803,NA,Her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other hand behind her waist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4805,4898,NA,Master she said in a low voice with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4900,4907,NA,Dont
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4909,5000,NA, I ll show you a wrist repeated Mr Jaggers with an immovable determination to show it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5002,5034,NA,Molly let them see your wrist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5036,5064,NA,Master she again murmured
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5066,5213,NA,Please Molly said Mr Jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room let them see  both  your wrists
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5215,5224,NA,Show them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5226,5231,NA,Come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5233,5298,NA,He took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5300,5377,NA,She brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by side
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5379,5459,NA,The last wrist was much disfigureddeeply scarred and scarred across and across
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5461,5596,NA,When she held her hands out she took her eyes from Mr Jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5598,5687,NA,Theres power here said Mr Jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5689,5746,NA,Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5748,5811,NA,Its remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5813,5926,NA,I have had occasion to notice many hands but I never saw stronger in that respect mans or womans than these
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5928,6058,NA,While he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6060,6105,NA,The moment he ceased she looked at him again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6107,6206,NA,Thatll do Molly said Mr Jaggers giving her a slight nod you have been admired and can go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6208,6363,NA,She withdrew her hands and went out of the room and Mr Jaggers putting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter filled his glass and passed round the wine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6365,6423,NA,At halfpast nine gentlemen said he we must break up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6425,6460,NA,Pray make the best use of your time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6462,6486,NA,I am glad to see you all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6488,6516,NA,Mr Drummle I drink to you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6518,6612,NA,If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more it perfectly succeeded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6614,6766,NA,In a sulky triumph Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6768,6847,NA,Through all his stages Mr Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6849,6908,NA,He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr Jaggerss wine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6910,7010,NA,In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink and I know we talked too much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7012,7127,NA,We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummles to the effect that we were too free with our money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7129,7294,NA,It led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it came with a bad grace from him to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7296,7337,NA,Well retorted Drummle hell be paid
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7339,7465,NA,I dont mean to imply that he wont said I but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money I should think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7467,7487,NA, You  should think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7489,7505,NA,retorted Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7507,7629,NA,Oh Lord I dare say I went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldnt lend money to any of us if we wanted it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7631,7660,NA,You are right said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7662,7700,NA,I wouldnt lend one of you a sixpence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7702,7737,NA,I wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7739,7802,NA,Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances I should say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7804,7840,NA, You  should say repeated Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7842,7851,NA,Oh Lord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7853,8154,NA,This was so very aggravatingthe more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtusenessthat I said disregarding Herberts efforts to check me Come Mr Drummle since we are on the subject Ill tell you what passed between Herbert here and me when you borrowed that money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8156,8239,NA, I  dont want to know what passed between Herbert there and you growled Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8241,8334,NA,And I think he added in a lower growl that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8336,8402,NA,Ill tell you however said I whether you want to know or not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8404,8536,NA,We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8538,8736,NA,Drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised plainly signifying that it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8738,8869,NA,Hereupon Startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than I had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8871,9028,NA,Startop being a lively bright young fellow and Drummle being the exact opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9030,9168,NA,He now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9170,9504,NA,Resenting this little success more than anything Drummle without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his pockets dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and would have flung it at his adversarys head but for our entertainers dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9506,9691,NA,Gentlemen said Mr Jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain I am exceedingly sorry to announce that its half past nine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9693,9727,NA,On this hint we all rose to depart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9729,9837,NA,Before we got to the street door Startop was cheerily calling Drummle old boy as if nothing had happened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9839,10001,NA,But the old boy was so far from responding that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way so Herbert and I who remained in town saw the

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,296,406,NA,I found him in his dressingroom surrounded by his stock of boots already hard at it washing his hands of us

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1629,1734,NA,He would call at Barnards Hotel Tuesday morning at nine oclock when if not agreeable please leave word
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1736,1786,NA,Your poor sister is much the same as when you left
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1788,1871,NA,We talk of you in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1873,1957,NA,If now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of poor old days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1959,2040,NA,No more dear Mr Pip from Your ever obliged and affectionate servant BIDDY
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2042,2046,NA,PS
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2048,2098,NA,He wishes me most particular to write  what larks 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2100,2127,NA,He says you will understand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2129,2272,NA,I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a worthy worthy man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2274,2397,NA,I have read him all excepting only the last little sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again  what larks 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2399,2499,NA,I received this letter by the post on Monday morning and therefore its appointment was for next day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2501,2575,NA,Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to Joes coming
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2577,2725,NA,Not with pleasure though I was bound to him by so many ties no with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of incongruity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2727,2807,NA,If I could have kept him away by paying money I certainly would have paid money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2809,2950,NA,My greatest reassurance was that he was coming to Barnards Inn not to Hammersmith and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummles way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2952,3146,NA,I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father for both of whom I had a respect but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle whom I held in contempt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3148,3274,NA,So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3276,3442,NA,I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3444,3620,NA,By this time the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them and I enjoyed the honour of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring upholsterer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3622,3772,NA,I had got on so fast of late that I had even started a boy in bootstop bootsin bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3774,4102,NA,For after I had made the monster out of the refuse of my washerwomans family and had clothed him with a blue coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots already mentioned I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4104,4327,NA,This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for floorcloth and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4329,4550,NA,While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate I had an odd halfprovoked sense of suspicion upon me that if Joe had been coming to see  him  he wouldnt have been quite so brisk about it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4552,4742,NA,However I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe and I got up early in the morning and caused the sittingroom and breakfasttable to assume their most splendid appearance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4744,4919,NA,Unfortunately the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak giant of a Sweep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4921,5071,NA,As the time approached I should have liked to run away but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently I heard Joe on the staircase
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5073,5272,NA,I knew it was Joe by his clumsy manner of coming upstairshis state boots being always too big for himand by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5274,5450,NA,When at last he stopped outside our door I could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5452,5563,NA,Finally he gave a faint single rap and Peppersuch was the compromising name of the avenging boyannounced Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5565,5573,NA,Gargery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5575,5704,NA,I thought he never would have done wiping his feet and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat but at last he came in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5706,5754,NA,Joe how are you Joe Pip how AIR you Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5756,5954,NA,With his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put down on the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down as if I had been the lastpatented Pump
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5956,5982,NA,I am glad to see you Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5984,6001,NA,Give me your hat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6003,6211,NA,But Joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a birdsnest with eggs in it wouldnt hear of parting with that piece of property and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6213,6410,NA,Which you have that growed said Joe and that swelled and that gentlefolked Joe considered a little before he discovered this word as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6412,6449,NA,And you Joe look wonderfully well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6451,6494,NA,Thank God said Joe Im ekerval to most
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6496,6541,NA,And your sister shes no worse than she were
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6543,6580,NA,And Biddy shes ever right and ready
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6582,6633,NA,And all friends is no backerder if not no forarder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6635,6667,NA,Ceptin Wopsle hes had a drop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6669,6856,NA,All this time still with both hands taking great care of the birdsnest Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressinggown
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6858,6968,NA,Had a drop Joe Why yes said Joe lowering his voice hes left the Church and went into the playacting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6970,7040,NA,Which the playacting have likeways brought him to London along with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7042,7217,NA,And his wish were said Joe getting the birdsnest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right if no offence as I would and you that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7219,7570,NA,I took what Joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled playbill of a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that very week of the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7572,7618,NA,Were you at his performance Joe I inquired
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7620,7669,NA,I  were  said Joe with emphasis and solemnity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7671,7700,NA,Was there a great sensation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7702,7767,NA,Why said Joe yes there certainly were a peck of orangepeel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7769,7801,NA,Partickler when he see the ghost
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7803,7978,NA,Though I put it to yourself sir whether it were calclated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with Amen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7980,8168,NA,A man may have had a misfortun and been in the Church said Joe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8170,8433,NA,Which I meantersay if the ghost of a mans own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention what can Sir Still more when his mourning at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off try to keep it on how you may
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8435,8527,NA,A ghostseeing effect in Joes own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8529,8638,NA,So I presented Joe to Herbert who held out his hand but Joe backed from it and held on by the birdsnest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8640,8988,NA,Your servant Sir said Joe which I hope as you and Piphere his eye fell on the Avenger who was putting some toast on table and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family that I frowned it down and confused him moreI meantersay you two gentlemenwhich I hope as you get your elths in this close spot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8990,9264,NA,For the present may be a werry good inn according to London opinions said Joe confidentially and I believe its character do stand it but I wouldnt keep a pig in it myselfnot in the case that I wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9266,9736,NA,Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwellingplace and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me sir Joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hatas if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting placeand ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimneypiece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9738,9828,NA,Do you take tea or coffee Mr Gargery asked Herbert who always presided of a morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9830,9932,NA,Thankee Sir said Joe stiff from head to foot Ill take whichever is most agreeable to yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9934,10001,NA,What do you say to coffee Thankee Sir returned Joe evidently

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,128,219,NA,But dont you never find it a little eating Say tea then said Herbert pouring it out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,221,352,NA,Here Joes hat tumbled off the mantelpiece and he started out of his chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,354,439,NA,As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,441,619,NA,When did you come to town Mr Gargery Were it yesterday afternoon said Joe after coughing behind his hand as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,621,636,NA,No it were not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,638,649,NA,Yes it were
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,651,654,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,656,756,NA,It were yesterday afternoon with an appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,758,889,NA,Have you seen anything of London yet Why yes Sir said Joe me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the Blacking Wareus
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,891,1082,NA,But we didnt find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors which I meantersay added Joe in an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1084,1308,NA,I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know into a perfect Chorus but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which was toppling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1310,1434,NA,Indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicketkeeping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1436,1849,NA,He made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill now rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped now merely stopping it midway beating it up and humouring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall before he felt it safe to close with it finally splashing it into the slopbasin where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7772,8003,NA,But when I had secured my boxplace by tomorrows coach and had been down to Mr Pockets and back I was not by any means convinced on the last point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8869,9127,NA,It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boars postingyard it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailors shop and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabbs boy

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,211,NA,nce seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,213,325,NA,But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word convict
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,327,370,NA,You dont mind them Handel said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,372,505,NA,O no I thought you seemed as if you didnt like them I cant pretend that I do like them and I suppose you dont particularly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,507,529,NA,But I dont mind them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,531,535,NA,See
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,537,590,NA,There they are said Herbert coming out of the Tap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,592,629,NA,What a degraded and vile sight it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,631,768,NA,They had been treating their guard I suppose for they had a gaoler with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,770,877,NA,The two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their legsirons of a pattern that I knew well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,879,924,NA,They wore the dress that I likewise knew well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,926,1264,NA,Their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried a thickknobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at the puttingto of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the Curator
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1266,1476,NA,One was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1478,1624,NA,His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes and his attire disguised him absurdly but I knew his halfclosed eye at one glance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1626,1775,NA,There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night and who had brought me down with his invisible gun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1777,1873,NA,It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1875,2120,NA,He looked across at me and his eye appraised my watchchain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle and looked at something else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2122,2473,NA,The great numbers on their backs as if they were street doors their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals their ironed legs apologetically garlanded with pockethandkerchiefs and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them made them as Herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2475,2507,NA,But this was not the worst of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2509,2706,NA,It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2708,3002,NA,Hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful and I dont know what else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3004,3281,NA,At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and the prisoners had come over with their keeperbringing with them that curious flavour of breadpoultice baize ropeyarn and hearthstone which attends the convict presence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3283,3387,NA,Dont take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger Ill sit next you myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3389,3427,NA,Ill put em on the outside of the row
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3429,3463,NA,They wont interfere with you sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3465,3496,NA,You neednt know theyre there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3498,3558,NA,And dont blame  me  growled the convict I had recognised
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3560,3581,NA, I  dont want to go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3584,3616,NA,I  am quite ready to stay behind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3618,3675,NA,As fur as I am concerned any ones welcome to  my  place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3677,3711,NA,Or mine said the other gruffly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3713,3776,NA, I  wouldnt have incommoded none of you if Id had  my  way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3778,3859,NA,Then they both laughed and began cracking nuts and spitting the shells aboutAs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3861,3954,NA,I really think I should have liked to do myself if I had been in their place and so despised
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3956,4093,NA,At length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4095,4336,NA,So he got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4338,4390,NA,Goodbye Handel Herbert called out as we started
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4392,4479,NA,I thought what a blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4481,4616,NA,It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convicts breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4618,4735,NA,The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid it set my very teeth on edge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4737,4941,NA,He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in doing it and I was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4943,5001,NA,The weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5003,5148,NA,It made us all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the Halfway House behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5150,5328,NA,I dozed off myself in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him and how it could best be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5330,5455,NA,In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses I woke in a fright and took the question up again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5457,5674,NA,But I must have lost it longer than I had thought since although I could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5676,5788,NA,Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind the convicts were closer to me than before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5790,5914,NA,The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious were the words of my own thought Two One Pound notes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5916,5971,NA,How did he get em said the convict I had never seen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5973,6012,NA,How should I know returned the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6014,6046,NA,He had em stowed away somehows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6048,6077,NA,Giv him by friends I expect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6079,6161,NA,I wish said the other with a bitter curse upon the cold that I had em here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6163,6218,NA,Two one pound notes or friends Two one pound notes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6220,6300,NA,Id sell all the friends I ever had for one and think it a blessed good bargain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6302,6306,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6308,6320,NA,So he says
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6322,6505,NA,So he says resumed the convict I had recognisedit was all said and done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the DockyardYoure agoing to be discharged Yes I was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6507,6607,NA,Would I find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two one pound notes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6609,6621,NA,Yes I would
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6623,6633,NA,And I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6635,6669,NA,More fool you growled the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6671,6721,NA,Id have spent em on a Man in wittles and drink
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6723,6752,NA,He must have been a green one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6754,6808,NA,Mean to say he knowed nothing of you Not a haporth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6810,6845,NA,Different gangs and different ships
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6847,6908,NA,He was tried again for prison breaking and got made a Lifer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6910,6934,NA,And was thatHonourthe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6936,7007,NA,only time you worked out in this part of the country The only time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7009,7057,NA,What might have been your opinion of the place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7059,7080,NA,A most beastly place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7082,7145,NA,Mudbank mist swamp and work work swamp mist and mudbank
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7147,7267,NA,They both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually growled themselves out and had nothing left to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7269,7462,NA,After overhearing this dialogue I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7464,7660,NA,Indeed I was not only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7662,7858,NA,Still the coincidence of our being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his hearing with my name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7860,7963,NA,For this reason I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7965,8000,NA,This device I executed successfully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8002,8213,NA,My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet I had but to turn a hinge to get it out I threw it down before me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8215,8335,NA,As to the convicts they went their way with the coach and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8337,8555,NA,In my fancy I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slimewashed stairsagain heard the gruff Give way you like and order to dogsagain saw the wicked Noahs Ark lying out on the black water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8557,8681,NA,I could not have said what I was afraid of for my fear was altogether undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6381,6546,NA,At last we went back into the house and there I heard with surprise that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business and would come back to dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6548,6726,NA,The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6728,6861,NA,It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6863,7061,NA,But in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before and I was under stronger enchantment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7063,7173,NA,The time so melted away that our early dinnerhour drew close at hand and Estella left us to prepare herself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7175,7349,NA,We had stopped near the centre of the long table and Miss Havisham with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7351,7522,NA,As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7524,7653,NA,Then Estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and said in a whisper Is she beautiful graceful wellgrown
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7655,7719,NA,Do you admire her Everybody must who sees her Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7721,7811,NA,She drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7813,7865,NA,Love her love her love her How does she use you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7867,7990,NA,Before I could answer if I could have answered so difficult a question at all she repeated Love her love her love her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7992,8020,NA,If she favours you love her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8022,8049,NA,If she wounds you love her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8051,8260,NA,If she tears your heart to piecesand as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeperlove her love her love her Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8262,8360,NA,I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8362,8375,NA,Hear me Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8377,8403,NA,I adopted her to be loved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8405,8445,NA,I bred her and educated her to be loved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8447,8504,NA,I developed her into what she is that she might be loved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8506,8515,NA,Love her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8517,8748,NA,She said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of lovedespairrevengedire deathit could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8750,8835,NA,Ill tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what real love is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8837,9031,NA,It is blind devotion unquestioning selfhumiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiteras I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9033,9122,NA,When she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that I caught her round the waist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9124,9278,NA,For she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9280,9312,NA,All this passed in a few seconds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9314,9429,NA,As I drew her down into her chair I was conscious of a scent that I knew and turning saw my guardian in the room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9431,9601,NA,He always carried I have not yet mentioned it I think a pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was of great value to him in his profession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9603,9942,NA,I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself that the selfcommittal has followed directly quite as a matter of course
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9944,10001,NA,When I saw him in the room he had this expressive pocketh

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,50,NA,handkerchief in both hands and was looking at us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,52,145,NA,On meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude Indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,147,226,NA,Singular and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,228,312,NA,Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I and was like everybody else afraid of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,314,405,NA,She made a strong attempt to compose herself and stammered that he was as punctual as ever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,407,458,NA,As punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,460,520,NA,How do you do Pip Shall I give you a ride Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,522,533,NA,Once round
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,535,652,NA,And so you are here Pip I told him when I had arrived and how Miss Havisham had wished me to come and see Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,654,864,NA,To which he replied Ah Very fine young lady Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him with one of his large hands and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket were full of secrets
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,866,955,NA,Well Pip How often have you seen Miss Estella before said he when he came to a stop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,957,973,NA,How often Ah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,975,989,NA,How many times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,991,1039,NA,Ten thousand times Oh Certainly not so many
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1041,1158,NA,Twice Jaggers interposed Miss Havisham much to my relief leave my Pip alone and go with him to your dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1160,1224,NA,He complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1226,1458,NA,While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat and drink offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred times and once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1460,1491,NA,I considered and said Never
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1493,1550,NA,And never will Pip he retorted with a frowning smile
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1552,1649,NA,She has never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this present life of hers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1651,1729,NA,She wanders about in the night and then lays hands on such food as she takes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1731,1778,NA,Pray sir said I may I ask you a question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1780,1831,NA,You may said he and I may decline to answer it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1833,1851,NA,Put your question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1853,1868,NA,Estellas name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1870,1889,NA,Is it Havisham or
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1891,1911,NA,I had nothing to add
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1913,1949,NA,Or what said he Is it Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1951,1967,NA,It is Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1969,2043,NA,This brought us to the dinnertable where she and Sarah Pocket awaited us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2045,2130,NA,Mr Jaggers presided Estella sat opposite to him I faced my green and yellow friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2132,2319,NA,We dined very well and were waited on by a maidservant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings but who for anything I know had been in that mysterious house the whole time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2321,2471,NA,After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the two ladies left us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2473,2581,NA,Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr Jaggers under that roof I never saw elsewhere even in him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2583,2685,NA,He kept his very looks to himself and scarcely directed his eyes to Estellas face once during dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2687,2792,NA,When she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered but never looked at her that I could see
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2794,2933,NA,On the other hand she often looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his face never showed the least consciousness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2935,3254,NA,Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he extortedand even did extort though I dont know howthose references out of my innocent self
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3256,3423,NA,And when he and I were left alone together he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that really was too much for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3425,3489,NA,He crossexamined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3491,3798,NA,He held it between himself and the candle tasted the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and crossexamined the glass again until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3800,4080,NA,Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use for he couldnt answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4082,4370,NA,I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her capwhich was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mopand strewing the ground with her hairwhich assuredly had never grown on  her  head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4372,4470,NA,She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss Havishams room and we four played at whist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4472,4823,NA,In the interval Miss Havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressingtable into Estellas hair and about her bosom and arms and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4825,5203,NA,Illustration Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased I say nothing nor of the feeling that I had respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5205,5308,NA,What I suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5310,5678,NA,It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him about her that I knew I could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her that I knew I could never bear to see him wash his hands of her it was that my admiration should be within a foot or two of himit was that my feelings should be in the same place with him that  was the agonizing circumstance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5680,5897,NA,We played until nine oclock and then it was arranged that when Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach and then I took leave of her and touched her and left her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5899,5951,NA,My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5953,6046,NA,Far into the night Miss Havishams words Love her love her love her sounded in my ears
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6048,6164,NA,I adapted them for my own repetition and said to my pillow I love her I love her I love her hundreds of times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6166,6268,NA,Then a burst of gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the blacksmiths boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6270,6409,NA,Then I thought if she were as I feared by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she begin to be interested in me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6411,6483,NA,When should I awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6485,6490,NA,Ah me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6492,6536,NA,I thought those were high and great emotions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6538,6667,NA,But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe because I knew she would be contemptuous of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6669,6783,NA,It was but a day gone and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried God forgive me soon dried
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6785,6796,NA,Chapter XXX
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6798,7011,NA,After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the morning I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlicks being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havishams
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7013,7215,NA,Why of course he is not the right sort of man Pip said my guardian comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7217,7429,NA,It seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7431,7533,NA,Very good Pip he observed when I had concluded Ill go round presently and pay our friend off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7535,7671,NA,Rather alarmed by this summary action I was for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7673,7827,NA,Oh no he wont said my guardian making his pockethandkerchiefpoint with perfect confidence I should like to see him argue the question with  me 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7829,8197,NA,As we were going back together to London by the midday coach and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk and that I would go on along the London road while Mr Jaggers was occupied if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8199,8271,NA,I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8273,8492,NA,By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechooks premises I got round into the High Street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in comparative security
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8494,8637,NA,It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared after
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8639,8952,NA,One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they had forgotten something and pass me face to faceon which occasions I dont know whether they or I made the worse pretence they of not doing it or I of not seeing it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8954,9111,NA,Still my position was a distinguished one and I was not at all dissatisfied with it until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant Trabbs boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9113,9253,NA,Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress I beheld Trabbs boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9255,9677,NA,Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind I advanced with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating myself on my success when suddenly the knees of Trabbs boy smote together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace Hold me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9679,9795,NA,Im so frightened feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9797,9931,NA,As I passed him his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9933,9984,NA,This was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,131,NA,ced another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement and indignation I again beheld Trabbs boy approaching
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,133,168,NA,He was coming round a narrow corner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,170,335,NA,His blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to Trabbs with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,337,561,NA,With a shock he became aware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,563,666,NA,His sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators and I felt utterly confounded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,668,794,NA,I had not got as much further down the street as the postoffice when I again beheld Trabbs boy shooting round by a back way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,796,830,NA,This time he was entirely changed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,832,1445,NA,He wore the blue bag in the manner of my greatcoat and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand Dont know yah Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabbs boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his shirtcollar twined his sidehair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his attendants Dont know yah dont know yah pon my soul dont know yah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1447,1752,NA,The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith culminated the disgrace with which I left the town and was so to speak ejected by it into the open country
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1754,1897,NA,Illustration But unless I had taken the life of Trabbs boy on that occasion I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1899,2055,NA,To have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his hearts best blood would have been futile and degrading
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2057,2232,NA,Moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew out again between his captors legs scornfully yelping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2234,2479,NA,I wrote however to Mr Trabb by next days post to say that Mr Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every respectable mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2481,2632,NA,The coach with Mr Jaggers inside came up in due time and I took my boxseat again and arrived in London safebut not sound for my heart was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2634,2791,NA,As soon as I arrived I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then went on to Barnards Inn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2793,2862,NA,I found Herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2864,3018,NA,Having despatched The Avenger to the coffeehouse for an addition to the dinner I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3020,3188,NA,As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole I sent him to the Play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3190,3363,NA,A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3365,3459,NA,So mean is extremity that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park corner to see what oclock it was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3461,3601,NA,Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender I said to Herbert My dear Herbert I have something very particular to tell you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3603,3678,NA,My dear Handel he returned I shall esteem and respect your confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3680,3741,NA,It concerns myself Herbert said I and one other person
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3743,3897,NA,Herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because I didnt go on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3899,3972,NA,Herbert said I laying my hand upon his knee I loveI adoreEstella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3974,4060,NA,Instead of being transfixed Herbert replied in an easy matterofcourse way Exactly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4062,4083,NA,Well Well Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4085,4104,NA,Is that all you say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4106,4146,NA,Well What next I mean said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4148,4173,NA,Of course I know  that 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4175,4230,NA,How do you know it said I How do I know it Handel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4232,4276,NA,Why from you I never told you Told me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4278,4370,NA,You have never told me when you have got your hair cut but I have had senses to perceive it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4372,4427,NA,You have always adored her ever since I have known you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4429,4490,NA,You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4492,4499,NA,Told me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4501,4542,NA,Why you have always told me all day long
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4544,4684,NA,When you told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4686,4795,NA,Very well then said I to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light I have never left off adoring her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4797,4862,NA,And she has come back a most beautiful and most elegant creature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4864,4887,NA,And I saw her yesterday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4889,5038,NA,And if I adored her before I now doubly adore her Lucky for you then Handel said Herbert that you are picked out for her and allotted to her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5040,5160,NA,Without encroaching on forbidden ground we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5162,5230,NA,Have you any idea yet of Estellas views on the adoration question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5232,5256,NA,I shook my head gloomily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5258,5261,NA,Oh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5263,5364,NA,She is thousands of miles away from me said I Patience my dear Handel time enough time enough
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5366,5490,NA,But you have something more to say I am ashamed to say it I returned and yet its no worse to say it than to think it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5492,5518,NA,You call me a lucky fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5520,5535,NA,Of course I am
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5537,5611,NA,I was a blacksmiths boy but yesterday I amwhat shall I say I amtoday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5613,5843,NA,Say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned Herbert smiling and clapping his hand on the back of minea good fellow with impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and dreaming curiously mixed in him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5845,5933,NA,I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5935,6022,NA,On the whole I by no means recognised the analysis but thought it not worth disputing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6024,6127,NA,When I ask what I am to call myself today Herbert I went on I suggest what I have in my thoughts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6129,6147,NA,You say I am lucky
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6149,6263,NA,I know I have done nothing to raise myself in life and that Fortune alone has raised me that is being very lucky
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6265,6422,NA,And yet when I think of Estella And when dont you you know Herbert threw in with his eyes on the fire which I thought kind and sympathetic of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6424,6541,NA,Then my dear Herbert I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6543,6688,NA,Avoiding forbidden ground as you did just now I may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6690,6780,NA,And at the best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what they are
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6782,6898,NA,In saying this I relieved my mind of what had always been there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6900,7086,NA,Now Handel Herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our gifthorses mouth with a magnifyingglass
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7088,7226,NA,Likewise it seems to me that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7228,7355,NA,Didnt you tell me that your guardian Mr Jaggers told you in the beginning that you were not endowed with expectations only
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7357,7578,NA,And even if he had not told you sothough that is a very large If I grantcould you believe that of all men in London Mr Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7580,7632,NA,I said I could not deny that this was a strong point
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7634,7762,NA,I said it people often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justiceas if I wanted to deny it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7764,7970,NA,I should think it  was  a strong point said Herbert and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you must bide your guardians time and he must bide his clients time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7972,8082,NA,Youll be oneandtwenty before you know where you are and then perhaps youll get some further enlightenment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8084,8237,NA,At all events youll be nearer getting it for it must come at last What a hopeful disposition you have said I gratefully admiring his cheery ways
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8239,8297,NA,I ought to have said Herbert for I have not much else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8299,8405,NA,I must acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own but my fathers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8407,8545,NA,The only remark I ever heard him make on your story was the final one The thing is settled and done or Mr Jaggers would not be in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8547,8744,NA,And now before I say anything more about my father or my fathers son and repay confidence with confidence I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a momentpositively repulsive
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8746,8841,NA,You wont succeed said I O yes I shall said he One two three and now I am in for it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8843,9120,NA,Handel my good fellowthough he spoke in this light tone he was very much in earnestI have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender that Estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9122,9244,NA,Am I right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never referred to her directly or indirectly in any way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9246,9353,NA,Never even hinted for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately Never
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9355,9441,NA,Now Handel I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes upon my soul and honour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9443,9541,NA,Not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from herI told you I should be disagreeable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9543,9841,NA,I turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge when the mists were solemnly rising and when I laid my hand upon the village fingerpost smote upon my heart again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9843,9890,NA,There was silence between us for a little while
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9892,10001,NA,Yes but my dear Handel Herbert went on as if we had been talking instead of silent its having been so

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,112,NA,strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very serious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,114,166,NA,Think of her bringingup and think of Miss Havisham

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,240,274,NA,This may lead to miserable things
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,276,359,NA,I know it Herbert said I with my head still turned away but I cant help it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,390,393,NA,No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,395,436,NA,Impossible You cant try Handel No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,438,604,NA,Impossible Well said Herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep and stirring the fire now Ill endeavour to make myself agreeable again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,606,902,NA,So he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs in their places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about looked into the hall peeped into the letterbox shut the door and came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left leg in both arms
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,904,987,NA,I was going to say a word or two Handel concerning my father and my fathers son
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,989,1137,NA,I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my fathers son to remark that my fathers establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1139,1210,NA,There is always plenty Herbert said I to say something encouraging
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1212,1337,NA,O yes and so the dustman says I believe with the strongest approval and so does the marinestore shop in the back street
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1339,1423,NA,Gravely Handel for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1425,1537,NA,I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up but if ever there was the time is gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1539,1740,NA,May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1742,1874,NA,This was such a singular question that I asked him in return Is it so I dont know said Herbert thats what I want to know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1876,1916,NA,Because it is decidedly the case with us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1918,2016,NA,My poor sister Charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen was a striking example
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2018,2041,NA,Little Jane is the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2043,2195,NA,In her desire to be matrimonially established you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2197,2300,NA,Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2302,2358,NA,And indeed I think we are all engaged except the baby
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2360,2425,NA,Then you are said I I am said Herbert but its a secret
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2427,2517,NA,I assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favoured with further particulars
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2519,2624,NA,He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2626,2646,NA,May I ask the name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2648,2654,NA,I said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2656,2685,NA,Name of Clara said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2687,2908,NA,Live in London Yes perhaps I ought to mention said Herbert who had become curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting theme that she is rather below my mothers nonsensical family notions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2910,2970,NA,Her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2972,3007,NA,I think he was a species of purser
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3009,3073,NA,What is he now said I Hes an invalid now replied Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3075,3123,NA,Living on On the first floor said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3125,3212,NA,Which was not at all what I meant for I had intended my question to apply to his means
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3214,3304,NA,I have never seen him for he has always kept his room overhead since I have known Clara
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3306,3337,NA,But I have heard him constantly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3339,3425,NA,He makes tremendous rowsroars and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3427,3526,NA,In looking at me and then laughing heartily Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3528,3711,NA,Dont you expect to see him said I O yes I constantly expect to see him returned Herbert because I never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3713,3760,NA,But I dont know how long the rafters may hold
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3762,3926,NA,When he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told me that the moment he began to realise Capital it was his intention to marry this young lady
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3928,4058,NA,He added as a selfevident proposition engendering low spirits But you  cant  marry you know while youre looking about you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4060,4202,NA,As we contemplated the fire and as I thought what a difficult vision to realise this same Capital sometimes was I put my hands in my pockets
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4204,4401,NA,A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention I opened it and found it to be the playbill I had received from Joe relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4403,4469,NA,And bless my heart I involuntarily added aloud its tonight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4471,4558,NA,This changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4560,4981,NA,So when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of Mr Wopsle and Denmark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4983,4995,NA,Chapter XXXI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4997,5130,NA,On our arrival in Denmark we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two armchairs on a kitchentable holding a Court
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5132,5479,NA,The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble boy in the washleather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5481,5614,NA,My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and I could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5616,5687,NA,Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5689,5869,NA,The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him to the tomb and to have brought it back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5871,6130,NA,The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6132,6271,NA,It was this I conceive which led to the Shades being advised by the gallery to turn overa recommendation which it took extremely ill
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6273,6483,NA,It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6485,6538,NA,This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6540,6911,NA,The Queen of Denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned as the kettledrum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6913,7241,NA,The noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able seaman a strolling actor a gravedigger a clergyman and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencingmatch on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7243,7437,NA,This gradually led to a want of toleration for him and evenon his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral serviceto the general indignation taking the form of nuts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7439,7761,NA,Lastly Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled Now the babys put to bed lets have supper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7763,7812,NA,Which to say the least of it was out of keeping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7814,7894,NA,Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7896,8000,NA,Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt the public helped him out with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8002,8201,NA,As for example on the question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes and some no and some inclining to both opinions said Toss up for it and quite a Debating Society arose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8203,8335,NA,When he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged with loud cries of Hear hear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8337,8659,NA,When he appeared with his stocking disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat fold in the top which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8661,8841,NA,On his taking the recordersvery like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the doorhe was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8843,8983,NA,When he recommended the player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said And dont  you  do it neither youre a deal worse than  him 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8985,9078,NA,And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr Wopsle on every one of these occasions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9080,9267,NA,But his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical washhouse on one side and a turnpike gate on the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9269,9412,NA,Mr Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way Look out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9414,9492,NA,Heres the undertaker a coming to see how youre a getting on with your work
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9494,9795,NA,I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment Waiter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9797,10001,NA,The arrival of the body for interment in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of an individual obn

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,257,372,NA,We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr Wopsle but they were too hopeless to be persisted in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,374,463,NA,Therefore we had sat feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,465,877,NA,I laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr Wopsles elocutionnot for old associations sake I am afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,879,1013,NA,When the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted I said to Herbert Let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1480,1523,NA,Shall we follow you A few steps please
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1525,1606,NA,When we were in a side alley he turned and asked How did you think he lookedI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1608,1620,NA,dressed him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1622,1851,NA,I dont know what he had looked like except a funeral with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1853,1887,NA,But I said he had looked very nice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1889,1968,NA,When he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak beautiful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1970,2108,NA,But judging from the wing it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queens apartment he might have made more of his stockings
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2110,2235,NA,I modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door into a sort of hot packingcase immediately behind it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2237,2431,NA,Here Mr Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments and here there was just room for us to look at him over one anothers shoulders by keeping the packingcase door or lid wide open
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2433,2485,NA,Gentlemen said Mr Wopsle I am proud to see you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2487,2536,NA,I hope Mr Pip you will excuse my sending round
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2538,2686,NA,I had the happiness to know you in former times and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged on the noble and the affluent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2688,2798,NA,Meanwhile Mr Waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to get himself out of his princely sables

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3055,3259,NA,With that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who on the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3261,3318,NA,I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3320,3508,NA,But then Mr Waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said Gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front Herbert said from behind at the same time poking me Capitally
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3510,3651,NA,So I said Capitally How did you like my reading of the character gentlemen said Mr Waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3653,3719,NA,Herbert said from behind again poking me Massive and concrete
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3721,3820,NA,So I said boldly as if I had originated it and must beg to insist upon it Massive and concrete
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3822,4016,NA,I am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said Mr Waldengarver with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time and holding on by the seat of the chair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4018,4138,NA,But Ill tell you one thing Mr Waldengarver said the man who was on his knees in which youre out in your reading
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4140,4148,NA,Now mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4150,4196,NA,I dont care who says contrairy I tell you so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4198,4268,NA,Youre out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4270,4595,NA,The last Hamlet as I dressed made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which was the last I went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever his reading brought him into profile I called out I dont see no wafers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4597,4633,NA,And at night his reading was lovely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4635,4850,NA,Mr Waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful DependentI overlook his folly and then said aloud My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve they will improve
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4852,4911,NA,Herbert and I said together O no doubt they would improve
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4913,5079,NA,Did you observe gentlemen said Mr Waldengarver that there was a man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the serviceI mean the representation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5081,5147,NA,We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5149,5182,NA,I added He was drunk no doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5184,5229,NA,O dear no sir said Mr Wopsle not drunk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5231,5266,NA,His employer would see to that sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5268,5313,NA,His employer would not allow him to be drunk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5315,5435,NA,You know his employer said I Mr Wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again performing both ceremonies very slowly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5437,5698,NA,You must have observed gentlemen said he an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity who went throughI will not say sustainedthe rôle if I may use a French expression of Claudius King of Denmark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5700,5731,NA,That is his employer gentlemen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5733,5756,NA,Such is the profession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5758,6071,NA,Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr Wopsle if he had been in despair I was so sorry for him as it was that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put onwhich jostled us out at the doorwayto ask Herbert what he thought of having him home to supper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6073,6327,NA,Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so therefore I invited him and he went to Barnards with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat until two oclock in the morning reviewing his success and developing his plans
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6329,6555,NA,I forget in detail what they were but I have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama and to end with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6557,6858,NA,Miserably I went to bed after all and miserably thought of Estella and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herberts Clara or play Hamlet to Miss Havishams Ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing twenty words of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6860,6873,NA,Chapter XXXII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6875,7116,NA,One day when I was busy with my books and Mr Pocket I received a note by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter for though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed I divined whose hand it was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7118,7286,NA,It had no set beginning as Dear Mr Pip or Dear Pip or Dear Sir or Dear Anything but ran thus I am to come to London the day after tomorrow by the midday coach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7288,7331,NA,I believe it was settled you should meet me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7333,7412,NA,At all events Miss Havisham has that impression and I write in obedience to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7414,7438,NA,She sends you her regard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7440,7456,NA,Yours ESTELLA
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7458,7620,NA,If there had been time I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion but as there was not I was fain to be content with those I had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7622,7703,NA,My appetite vanished instantly and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7705,7892,NA,Not that its arrival brought me either for then I was worse than ever and began haunting the coachoffice in Wood Street Cheapside before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7894,8181,NA,For all that I knew this perfectly well I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coachoffice be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first halfhour of a watch of four or five hours when Wemmick ran against me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8183,8225,NA,Halloa Mr Pip said he how do you do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8227,8277,NA,I should hardly have thought this was  your  beat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8279,8399,NA,I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8401,8469,NA,Both flourishing thankye said Wemmick and particularly the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8471,8496,NA,Hes in wonderful feather
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8498,8531,NA,Hell be eightytwo next birthday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8533,8676,NA,I have a notion of firing eightytwo times if the neighbourhood shouldnt complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8678,8710,NA,However this is not London talk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8712,8808,NA,Where do you think I am going to To the office said I for he was tending in that direction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8810,8870,NA,Next thing to it returned Wemmick I am going to Newgate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8872,9046,NA,We are in a bankersparcel case just at present and I have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word or two with our client
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9048,9084,NA,Did your client commit the robbery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9086,9093,NA,I asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9095,9155,NA,Bless your soul and body no answered Wemmick very drily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9157,9181,NA,But he is accused of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9183,9203,NA,So might you or I be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9205,9251,NA,Either of us might be accused of it you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9253,9288,NA,Only neither of us is I remarked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9290,9385,NA,Yah said Wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger youre a deep one Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9387,9452,NA,Would you like to have a look at Newgate Have you time to spare
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9454,9613,NA,I had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coachoffice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9615,9913,NA,Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him I went into the office and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expectedwhich I knew beforehand quite as well as he
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9915,10001,NA,I then rejoined Mr Wemmick and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,52,NA,the information I had received accepted his offer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,54,229,NA,We were at Newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules into the interior of the jail
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,231,419,NA,At that time jails were much neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoingand which is always its heaviest and longest punishmentwas still far off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,421,607,NA,So felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their soup
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,609,838,NA,It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in and a potman was going his rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying beer and talking to friends and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing scene it was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,840,939,NA,It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,941,1073,NA,This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying What Captain Tom Are  you  there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1075,1136,NA,Ah indeed and also Is that Black Bill behind the cistern
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1138,1207,NA,Why I didnt look for you these two months how do you find yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1209,1521,NA,Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperersalways singlyWemmick with his postoffice in an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1523,1728,NA,He was highly popular and I found that he took the familiar department of Mr Jaggerss business though something of the state of Mr Jaggers hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1730,1951,NA,His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands and then tightening the postoffice and putting his hands in his pockets
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1953,2145,NA,In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees and then Mr Wemmick backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced said its no use my boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2147,2169,NA,Im only a subordinate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2171,2186,NA,I cant take it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2188,2230,NA,Dont go on in that way with a subordinate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2232,2524,NA,If you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may be worth the while of another thats my recommendation to you speaking as a subordinate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2526,2555,NA,Dont try on useless measures
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2557,2571,NA,Why should you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2573,2589,NA,Now whos next
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2591,2710,NA,Thus we walked through Wemmicks greenhouse until he turned to me and said Notice the man I shall shake hands with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2712,2798,NA,I should have done so without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2800,3220,NA,Almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom I can see now as I write in a wellworn olivecoloured frockcoat with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner of the bars and put his hand to his hatwhich had a greasy and fatty surface like cold brothwith a halfserious and halfjocose military salute
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3222,3303,NA,Colonel to you said Wemmick how are you Colonel All right Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3305,3394,NA,Everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong for us Colonel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3396,3445,NA,Yes it was too strong sirbut  I  dont care
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3447,3497,NA,No no said Wemmick coolly  you  dont care
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3499,3548,NA,Then turning to me Served His Majesty this man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3550,3601,NA,Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3603,3619,NA,I said Indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3621,3767,NA,and the mans eyes looked at me and then looked over my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3769,3836,NA,I think I shall be out of this on Monday sir he said to Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3838,3893,NA,Perhaps returned my friend but theres no knowing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3895,4018,NA,I am glad to have the chance of bidding you goodbye Mr Wemmick said the man stretching out his hand between two bars
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4020,4067,NA,Thankye said Wemmick shaking hands with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4069,4091,NA,Same to you Colonel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4093,4298,NA,If what I had upon me when taken had been real Mr Wemmick said the man unwilling to let his hand go I should have asked the favour of your wearing another ringin acknowledgment of your attentions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4300,4349,NA,Ill accept the will for the deed said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4351,4395,NA,By the by you were quite a pigeonfancier
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4397,4425,NA,The man looked up at the sky
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4427,4476,NA,I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4479,4656,NA,Could  you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair if youve no further use for em It shall be done sir All right said Wemmick they shall be taken care of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4658,4681,NA,Goodafternoon Colonel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4683,4692,NA,Goodbye
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4694,4790,NA,They shook hands again and as we walked away Wemmick said to me A Coiner a very good workman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4792,4869,NA,The Recorders report is made today and he is sure to be executed on Monday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4871,4958,NA,Still you see as far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4960,5146,NA,With that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5148,5324,NA,As we came out of the prison through the lodge I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less than by those whom they held in charge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5326,5543,NA,Well Mr Wemmick said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other whats Mr Jaggers going to do with that waterside murder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5545,5615,NA,Is he going to make it manslaughter or whats he going to make of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5617,5640,NA,Why dont you ask him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5642,5658,NA,returned Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5660,5697,NA,O yes I dare say said the turnkey
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5699,5808,NA,Now thats the way with them here Mr Pip remarked Wemmick turning to me with his postoffice elongated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5810,5929,NA,They dont mind what they ask of me the subordinate but youll never catch em asking any questions of my principal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5931,6066,NA,Is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your office asked the turnkey with a grin at Mr Wemmicks humour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6068,6195,NA,There he goes again you see cried Wemmick I told you so Asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6197,6486,NA,Well supposing Mr Pip is one of them Why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what Mr Jaggers is Yah cried Wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way youre dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal you know you are
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6488,6583,NA,Let us out you old fox or Ill get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6585,6726,NA,The turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6728,6922,NA,Mind you Mr Pip said Wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm to be more confidential I dont know that Mr Jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6924,6943,NA,Hes always so high
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6945,7005,NA,His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7007,7119,NA,That Colonel durst no more take leave of  him  than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7121,7233,NA,Then between his height and them he slips in his subordinatedont you seeand so he has em soul and body
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7235,7315,NA,I was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardians subtlety
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7317,7444,NA,To confess the truth I very heartily wished and not for the first time that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7446,7668,NA,Mr Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain where suppliants for Mr Jaggerss notice were lingering about as usual and I returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice with some three hours on hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7670,8071,NA,I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening I should have first encountered it that it should have reappeared on two occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8073,8264,NA,While my mind was thus engaged I thought of the beautiful young Estella proud and refined coming towards me and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8266,8461,NA,I wished that Wemmick had not met me or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him so that of all days in the year on this day I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8463,8592,NA,I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro and I shook it out of my dress and I exhaled its air from my lungs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8594,8839,NA,So contaminated did I feel remembering who was coming that the coach came quickly after all and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr Wemmicks conservatory when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8841,8914,NA,What  was  the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8916,8930,NA,Chapter XXXIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8932,9050,NA,In her furred travellingdress Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9052,9185,NA,Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and I thought I saw Miss Havishams influence in the change
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9187,9391,NA,We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and when it was all collected I rememberedhaving forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhilethat I knew nothing of her destination
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9393,9430,NA,I am going to Richmond she told me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9432,9550,NA,Our lesson is that there are two Richmonds one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire and that mine is the Surrey Richmond
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9552,9577,NA,The distance is ten miles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9579,9626,NA,I am to have a carriage and you are to take me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9628,9685,NA,This is my purse and you are to pay my charges out of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9687,9713,NA,O you must take the purse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9715,9773,NA,We have no choice you and I but to obey our instructions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9775,9921,NA,We are not free to follow our own devices you and I As she looked at me in giving me the purse I hoped there was an inner meaning in her words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9923,9974,NA,She said them slightingly but not with displeasure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9976,10001,NA,A carriage will have to b

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,53,156,NA,Yes I am to rest here a little and I am to drink some tea and you are to take care of me the while
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,158,360,NA,She drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life to show us a private sittingroom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,362,673,NA,Upon that he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clue without which he couldnt find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article considering the holes proportions an anchovy saucecruet and somebodys pattens
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,675,844,NA,On my objecting to this retreat he took us into another room with a dinnertable for thirty and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copybook under a bushel of coaldust
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,846,1035,NA,Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order which proving to be merely Some tea for the lady sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1037,1318,NA,I was and I am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong combination of stable with soupstock might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1320,1374,NA,Yet the room was all in all to me Estella being in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1376,1438,NA,I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1440,1511,NA,I was not at all happy there at the time observe and I knew it well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1513,1550,NA,Where are you going to at Richmond
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1552,1567,NA,I asked Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1569,1765,NA,I am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there who has the poweror says she hasof taking me about and introducing me and showing people to me and showing me to people
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1767,1842,NA,I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration Yes I suppose so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1844,1937,NA,She answered so carelessly that I said You speak of yourself as if you were some one else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1939,1981,NA,Where did you learn how I speak of others
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1983,2107,NA,Come come said Estella smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to  you  I must talk in my own way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2109,2143,NA,How do you thrive with Mr Pocket
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2145,2232,NA,I live quite pleasantly there at least It appeared to me that I was losing a chance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2234,2262,NA,At least repeated Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2264,2396,NA,As pleasantly as I could anywhere away from you You silly boy said Estella quite composedly how can you talk such nonsense
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2398,2472,NA,Your friend Mr Matthew I believe is superior to the rest of his family
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2474,2495,NA,Very superior indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2497,2594,NA,He is nobodys enemy Dont add but his own interposed Estella for I hate that class of man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2596,2677,NA,But he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite I have heard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2679,2959,NA,I am sure I have every reason to say so You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said Estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2961,3099,NA,They watch you misrepresent you write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3101,3175,NA,You can scarcely realise to yourself the hatred those people feel for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3177,3205,NA,They do me no harm I hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3207,3255,NA,Instead of answering Estella burst out laughing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3257,3333,NA,This was very singular to me and I looked at her in considerable perplexity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3335,3526,NA,When she left offand she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoymentI said in my diffident way with her I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3528,3574,NA,No no you may be sure of that said Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3576,3626,NA,You may be certain that I laugh because they fail
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3628,3694,NA,O those people with Miss Havisham and the tortures they undergo
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3696,3876,NA,She laughed again and even now when she had told me why her laughter was very singular to me for I could not doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3878,3989,NA,I thought there must really be something more here than I knew she saw the thought in my mind and answered it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3991,4186,NA,It is not easy for even you said Estella to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4188,4254,NA,For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4256,4261,NA,I was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4263,4437,NA,You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4439,4444,NA,I had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4446,4636,NA,You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4638,4644,NA,I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4646,4753,NA,It was no laughing matter with Estella now nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4755,4841,NA,I would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4843,4884,NA,Two things I can tell you said Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4886,5131,NA,First notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set your mind at rest that these people never willnever would in a hundred yearsimpair your ground with Miss Havisham in any particular great or small
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5133,5248,NA,Second I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5250,5356,NA,As she gave it to me playfullyfor her darker mood had been but momentaryI held it and put it to my lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5358,5422,NA,You ridiculous boy said Estella will you never take warning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5424,5560,NA,Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek What spirit was that said I I must think a moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5562,5612,NA,A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5614,5708,NA,If I say yes may I kiss the cheek again You should have asked before you touched the hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5710,5732,NA,But yes if you like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5734,5786,NA,I leaned down and her calm face was like a statues
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5788,5934,NA,Now said Estella gliding away the instant I touched her cheek you are to take care that I have some tea and you are to take me to Richmond
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5936,6096,NA,Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our intercourse did give me pain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6098,6241,NA,Whatever her tone with me happened to be I could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet I went on against trust and against hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6243,6273,NA,Why repeat it a thousand times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6275,6291,NA,So it always was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6293,6449,NA,I rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clue brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of tea not a glimpse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6451,6966,NA,A teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with expressing in his countenance burden and suffering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6968,7106,NA,After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7108,7230,NA,These I steeped in hot water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I dont know what for Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7232,7501,NA,The bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten and the chambermaid taken into considerationin a word the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and Estellas purse much lightenedwe got into our postcoach and drove away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7503,7612,NA,Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7614,7634,NA,What place is that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7636,7652,NA,Estella asked me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7654,7729,NA,I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it and then told her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7731,7801,NA,As she looked at it and drew in her head again murmuring Wretches
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7803,7863,NA,I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7865,7868,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7870,8027,NA,Jaggers said I by way of putting it neatly on somebody else has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8029,8110,NA,He is more in the secrets of every place I think said Estella in a low voice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8112,8252,NA,You have been accustomed to see him often I suppose I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since I can remember
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8254,8323,NA,But I know him no better now than I did before I could speak plainly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8325,8359,NA,What is your own experience of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8361,8385,NA,Do you advance with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8387,8463,NA,Once habituated to his distrustful manner said I I have done very well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8465,8483,NA,Are you intimate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8485,8529,NA,I have dined with him at his private house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8531,8596,NA,I fancy said Estella shrinking that must be a curious place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8598,8621,NA,It is a curious place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8623,8845,NA,I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8847,9046,NA,It seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before and when we were out of it I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9048,9213,NA,So we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling and about what parts of London lay on this side of it and what on that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9215,9417,NA,The great city was almost new to her she told me for she had never left Miss Havishams neighbourhood until she had gone to France and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9419,9491,NA,I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9493,9548,NA,To that she emphatically said God forbid and no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9550,9707,NA,It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task had needed pains
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9709,9998,NA,Yet this made me none the happier for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,168,NA,hen we passed through Hammersmith I showed her where Mr Matthew Pocket lived and said it was no great way from Richmond and that I hoped I should see her sometimes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,170,308,NA,O yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,310,377,NA,I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,379,423,NA,No there are only two mother and daughter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,425,506,NA,The mother is a lady of some station though not averse to increasing her income
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,508,566,NA,I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,568,800,NA,It is a part of Miss Havishams plans for me Pip said Estella with a sigh as if she were tired I am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how I go onI and the jewelsfor they are nearly all mine now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,802,857,NA,It was the first time she had ever called me by my name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,859,928,NA,Of course she did so purposely and knew that I should treasure it up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,930,1164,NA,We came to Richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house by the greena staid old house where hoops and powder and patches embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their court days many a time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1166,1447,NA,Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1449,1756,NA,A bell with an old voicewhich I dare say in its time had often said to the house Here is the green farthingale Here is the diamondhilted sword Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitairesounded gravely in the moonlight and two cherrycoloured maids came fluttering out to receive Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1758,1879,NA,The doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she gave me her hand and a smile and said goodnight and was absorbed likewise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1881,2044,NA,And still I stood looking at the house thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her and knowing that I never was happy with her but always miserable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2046,2176,NA,I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith and I got in with a bad heartache and I got out with a worse heartache
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2178,2355,NA,At our own door I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover and I envied her little lover in spite of his being subject to Flopson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2357,2564,NA,Mr Pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best textbooks on those themes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2566,2794,NA,But Mrs Pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of the babys having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the Foot Guards of Millers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2796,2954,NA,And more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2956,3191,NA,Mr Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind I had some notion in my heartache of begging him to accept my confidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3193,3357,NA,But happening to look up at Mrs Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby I thoughtWellNo I wouldnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3359,3372,NA,Chapter XXXIV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3374,3497,NA,As I had grown accustomed to my expectations I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3499,3633,NA,Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible but I knew very well that it was not all good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3635,3706,NA,I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3708,3766,NA,My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3768,4025,NA,When I woke up in the nightlike CamillaI used to think with a weariness on my spirits that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havishams face and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4027,4179,NA,Many a time of an evening when I sat alone looking at the fire I thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4181,4342,NA,Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4344,4509,NA,That is to say supposing I had had no expectations and yet had had Estella to think of I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4511,4735,NA,Now concerning the influence of my position on others I was in no such difficulty and so I perceivedthough dimly enough perhapsthat it was not beneficial to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4737,4902,NA,My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4904,5158,NA,I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if I had left them slumbering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5160,5407,NA,But Herberts was a very different case and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing the Canarybreasted Avenger at his disposal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5409,5510,NA,So now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease I began to contract a quantity of debt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5512,5580,NA,I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too so he soon followed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5582,5928,NA,At Startops suggestion we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove the object of which institution I have never divined if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5930,6227,NA,I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society which ran Gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6229,6529,NA,The Finches spent their money foolishly the Hotel we dined at was in Covent Garden and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6531,6717,NA,Occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron and I saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional waylike coals
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6719,6856,NA,But here I anticipate a little for I was not a Finch and could not be according to the sacred laws of the society until I came of age
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6858,7018,NA,In my confidence in my own resources I would willingly have taken Herberts expenses on myself but Herbert was proud and I could make no such proposal to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7020,7099,NA,So he got into difficulties in every direction and continued to look about him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7101,7676,NA,When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfasttime that he began to look about him more hopefully about midday that he drooped when he came into dinner that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance rather clearly after dinner that he all but realised Capital towards midnight and that at about two oclock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7678,7806,NA,I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond whereof separately by and by
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7808,8011,NA,Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8013,8133,NA,But in the general tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was a thing to transact itself somehow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8135,8244,NA,In the meantime Mr Pocket grew greyer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8246,8489,NA,While Mrs Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read her book of dignities lost her pockethandkerchief told us about her grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8491,8702,NA,As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnards Inn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8704,8811,NA,We spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8813,8907,NA,We were always more or less miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8909,9024,NA,There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9026,9103,NA,To the best of my belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9105,9186,NA,Every morning with an air ever new Herbert went into the City to look about him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9188,9431,NA,I often paid him a visit in the dark backroom in which he consorted with an inkjar a hatpeg a coalbox a stringbox an almanac a desk and stool and a ruler and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9433,9544,NA,If we all did what we undertake to do as faithfully as Herbert did we might live in a Republic of the Virtues
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9546,9709,NA,He had nothing else to do poor fellow except at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to Lloydsin observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9711,9810,NA,He never did anything else in connection with Lloyds that I could find out except come back again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9812,10001,NA,When he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively must find an opening he would go on Change at a busy time and walk in and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure am

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,28,NA,mong the assembled magnates
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,30,220,NA,For says Herbert to me coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions I find the truth to be Handel that an opening wont come to one but one must go to itso I have been
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,222,329,NA,If we had been less attached to one another I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,331,577,NA,I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the sight of the Avengers livery which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the fourandtwenty hours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,579,1018,NA,As we got more and more into debt breakfast became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at breakfasttime threatened by letter with legal proceedings not unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feetso that he was actually in the air like a booted Cupidfor presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1020,1202,NA,At certain timesmeaning at uncertain times for they depended on our humourI would say to Herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery My dear Herbert we are getting on badly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1204,1349,NA,My dear Handel Herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1351,1415,NA,Then Herbert I would respond let us look into our affairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1417,1500,NA,We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1502,1624,NA,I always thought this was business this was the way to confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1626,1659,NA,And I know Herbert thought so too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1661,1867,NA,We ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1869,1984,NA,Dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1986,2057,NA,For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2059,2237,NA,I would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a neat hand the heading Memorandum of Pips debts with Barnards Inn and the date very carefully added
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2239,2358,NA,Herbert would also take a sheet of paper and write across it with similar formalities Memorandum of Herberts debts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2360,2587,NA,Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the lookingglass and otherwise damaged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2589,2774,NA,The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2776,2844,NA,In point of meritorious character the two things seemed about equal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2846,2915,NA,When we had written a little while I would ask Herbert how he got on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2917,3034,NA,Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3036,3199,NA,They are mounting up Handel Herbert would say upon my life they are mounting up Be firm Herbert I would retort plying my own pen with great assiduity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3201,3228,NA,Look the thing in the face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3230,3252,NA,Look into your affairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3254,3284,NA,Stare them out of countenance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3286,3353,NA,So I would Handel only they are staring  me  out of countenance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3355,3444,NA,However my determined manner would have its effect and Herbert would fall to work again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3446,3577,NA,After a time he would give up once more on the plea that he had not got Cobbss bill or Lobbss or Nobbss as the case might be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3579,3651,NA,Then Herbert estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3653,3728,NA,What a fellow of resource you are my friend would reply with admiration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3730,3779,NA,Really your business powers are very remarkable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3781,3797,NA,I thought so too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3799,3941,NA,I established with myself on these occasions the reputation of a firstrate man of businessprompt decisive energetic clear coolheaded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3943,4049,NA,When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list I compared each with the bill and ticked it off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4051,4122,NA,My selfapproval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4124,4265,NA,When I had no more ticks to make I folded all my bills up uniformly docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4267,4416,NA,Then I did the same for Herbert who modestly said he had not my administrative genius and felt that I had brought his affairs into a focus for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4418,4500,NA,My business habits had one other bright feature which I called leaving a Margin
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4502,4663,NA,For example supposing Herberts debts to be one hundred and sixtyfour pounds fourandtwopence I would say Leave a margin and put them down at two hundred
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4665,4770,NA,Or supposing my own to be four times as much I would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4772,4927,NA,I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back I deem it to have been an expensive device
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4929,5111,NA,For we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted got pretty far on into another margin
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5113,5266,NA,But there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable opinion of myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5268,5494,NA,Soothed by my exertions my method and Herberts compliments I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationery and feel like a Bank of some sort rather than a private individual
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5496,5587,NA,We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we might not be interrupted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5589,5724,NA,I had fallen into my serene state one evening when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on the ground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5726,5839,NA,Its for you Handel said Herbert going out and coming back with it and I hope there is nothing the matter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5841,5896,NA,This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5898,6229,NA,The letter was signed Trabb  Co and its contents were simply that I was an honoured sir and that they begged to inform me that Mrs J Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three oclock in the afternoon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6231,6243,NA,Chapter XXXV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6245,6365,NA,It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6367,6449,NA,The figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6451,6732,NA,That the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6734,6980,NA,In my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were still alive and had been often there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6982,7081,NA,Whatever my fortunes might have been I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7083,7163,NA,But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7165,7459,NA,Under its influence and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick or any one else to the last extremity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7461,7639,NA,Having written to Joe to offer him consolation and to assure him that I would come to the funeral I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7641,7743,NA,I went down early in the morning and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7745,7900,NA,It was fine summer weather again and as I walked along the times when I was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me vividly returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7902,7987,NA,But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7989,8195,NA,For now the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8197,8318,NA,At last I came within sight of the house and saw that Trabb and Co had put in a funereal execution and taken possession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8320,8771,NA,Two dismally absurd persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandageas if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybodywere posted at the front door and in one of them I recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8773,9084,NA,All the children of the village and most of the women were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge and as I came up one of the two warders the postboy knocked at the doorimplying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9086,9215,NA,Another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9217,9383,NA,Here Mr Trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves up and was holding a kind of black Bazaar with the aid of a quantity of black pins
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9385,9537,NA,At the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting somebodys hat into black longclothes like an African baby so he held out his hand for mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9539,9657,NA,But I misled by the action and confused by the occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9659,9856,NA,Poor dear Joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by Trabb
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9858,10001,NA,When I bent down and said to him Dear Joe how are you he said Pip old chap you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and claspe

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,28,NA,ed my hand and said no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,30,135,NA,Biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly here and there and was very helpful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,137,306,NA,When I had spoken to Biddy as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe and there began to wonder in what part of the house itshemy sisterwas
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,308,718,NA,The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweetcake I looked about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cutup plum cake upon it and there were cutup oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used in all my life one full of port and one of sherry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,720,928,NA,Standing at this table I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself and making obsequious movements to catch my attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,930,1060,NA,The moment he succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said in a subdued voice May I dear sir and did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1062,1157,NA,I then descried Mr and Mrs Hubble the lastnamed in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1159,1275,NA,We were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up separately by Trabb into ridiculous bundles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1277,1763,NA,Which I meantersay Pip Joe whispered me as we were being what Mr Trabb called formed in the parlour two and twoand it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance which I meantersay sir as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms but it were considered wot the neighbours would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1765,1863,NA,Pockethandkerchiefs out all cried Mr Trabb at this point in a depressed businesslike voice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1865,1890,NA,Pockethandkerchiefs out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1892,1905,NA,We are ready
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1907,2071,NA,So we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces as if our noses were bleeding and filed out two and two Joe and I Biddy and Pumblechook Mr and Mrs Hubble
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2073,2457,NA,The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along under the guidance of two keepersthe postboy and his comrade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2459,2732,NA,The neighbourhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2734,2878,NA,At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy  Here  they come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2880,2926,NA, Here  they are and we were all but cheered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2928,3116,NA,In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing my cloak
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3118,3299,NA,My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr and Mrs Hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3301,3560,NA,And now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard close to the graves of my unknown parents Philip Pirrip late of this parish and Also Georgiana Wife of the Above
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3562,3722,NA,And there my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3724,4165,NA,Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4167,4382,NA,When we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honour and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4384,4629,NA,After that he drank all the rest of the sherry and Mr Hubble drank the port and the two talked which I have since observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4631,4814,NA,Finally he went away with Mr and Mrs Hubbleto make an evening of it I felt sure and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4816,4983,NA,When they were all gone and when Trabb and his menbut not his Boy I looked for himhad crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too the house felt wholesomer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4985,5252,NA,Soon afterwards Biddy Joe and I had a cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlour not in the old kitchen and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great restraint upon us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5254,5439,NA,But after dinner when I made him take his pipe and when I had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5441,5638,NA,I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress in which the dear fellow looked natural and like the Man he was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5640,5810,NA,He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room and I was pleased too for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5812,5934,NA,When the shadows of evening were closing in I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5936,6015,NA,Biddy said I I think you might have written to me about these sad matters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6017,6046,NA,Do you Mr Pip said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6048,6093,NA,I should have written if I had thought that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6095,6201,NA,Dont suppose that I mean to be unkind Biddy when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6203,6220,NA,Do you Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6222,6351,NA,She was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with her that I did not like the thought of making her cry again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6353,6442,NA,After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me I gave up that point
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6444,6520,NA,I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now Biddy dear Oh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6522,6608,NA,I cant do so Mr Pip said Biddy in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6610,6679,NA,I have been speaking to Mrs Hubble and I am going to her tomorrow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6681,6771,NA,I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr Gargery together until he settles down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6773,6806,NA,How are you going to live Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6808,6920,NA,If you want any mo How am I going to live repeated Biddy striking in with a momentary flush upon her face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6922,6945,NA,Ill tell you Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6947,7032,NA,I am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7034,7165,NA,I can be well recommended by all the neighbours and I hope I can be industrious and patient and teach myself while I teach others
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7167,7381,NA,You know Mr Pip pursued Biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new schools are not like the old but I learnt a good deal from you after that time and have had time since then to improve
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7383,7449,NA,I think you would always improve Biddy under any circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7451,7454,NA,Ah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7456,7510,NA,Except in my bad side of human nature murmured Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7512,7575,NA,It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7577,7581,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7583,7623,NA,I thought I would give up that point too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7625,7704,NA,So I walked a little further with Biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7706,7768,NA,I have not heard the particulars of my sisters death Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7770,7803,NA,They are very slight poor thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7805,7999,NA,She had been in one of her bad statesthough they had got better of late rather than worsefor four days when she came out of it in the evening just at teatime and said quite plainly Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8001,8097,NA,As she had never said any word for a long while I ran and fetched in Mr Gargery from the forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8099,8210,NA,She made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms round his neck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8212,8312,NA,So I put them round his neck and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8314,8386,NA,And so she presently said Joe again and once Pardon and once Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8388,8531,NA,And so she never lifted her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed because we found she was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8533,8646,NA,Biddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were coming out were blurred in my own sight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8648,8695,NA,Nothing was ever discovered Biddy Nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8697,8819,NA,Do you know what is become of Orlick I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in the quarries
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8821,8948,NA,Of course you have seen him thenWhy are you looking at that dark tree in the lane I saw him there on the night she died
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8950,9056,NA,That was not the last time either Biddy No I have seen him there since we have been walking hereIt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9058,9217,NA,is of no use said Biddy laying her hand upon my arm as I was for running out you know I would not deceive you he was not there a minute and he is gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9219,9336,NA,It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow and I felt inveterate against him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9338,9445,NA,I told her so and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9447,9730,NA,By degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she told me how Joe loved me and how Joe never complained of anythingshe didnt say of me she had no need I knew what she meantbut ever did his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a gentle heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9732,9885,NA,Indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said I and Biddy we must often speak of these things for of course I shall be often down here now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9887,9926,NA,I am not going to leave poor Joe alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9928,9958,NA,Biddy said never a single word

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,149,NA, Not to mention your calling me Mr Pipwhich appears to me to be in bad taste Biddywhat do you mean What do I mean asked Biddy timidly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,151,276,NA,Biddy said I in a virtuously selfasserting manner I must request to know what you mean by this By this said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,278,307,NA,Now dont echo I retorted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,309,338,NA,You used not to echo Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,340,362,NA,Used not said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,364,374,NA,O Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,376,387,NA,Used Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,389,436,NA,I rather thought I would give up that point too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,438,511,NA,After another silent turn in the garden I fell back on the main position
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,513,637,NA,Biddy said I I made a remark respecting my coming down here often to see Joe which you received with a marked silence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,639,857,NA,Have the goodness Biddy to tell me why Are you quite sure then that you WILL come to see him often asked Biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,859,938,NA,O dear me said I as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,940,987,NA,This really is a very bad side of human nature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,989,1029,NA,Dont say any more if you please Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1031,1056,NA,This shocks me very much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1058,1297,NA,For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper and when I went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her as I could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1299,1463,NA,As often as I was restless in the night and that was every quarter of an hour I reflected what an unkindness what an injury what an injustice Biddy had done me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1465,1497,NA,Early in the morning I was to go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1499,1596,NA,Early in the morning I was out and looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1598,1793,NA,There I stood for minutes looking at Joe already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1795,1914,NA,Goodbye dear JoeNo dont wipe it offfor Gods sake give me your blackened handI shall be down soon and often
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1916,2081,NA,Illustration Never too soon sir said Joe and never too often Pip Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2083,2167,NA,Biddy said I when I gave her my hand at parting I am not angry but I am hurt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2169,2270,NA,No dont be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically let only me be hurt if I have been ungenerous
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2272,2321,NA,Once more the mists were rising as I walked away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2323,2477,NA,If they disclosed to me as I suspect they did that I should  not  come back and that Biddy was quite right all I can say isthey were quite right too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2479,2492,NA,Chapter XXXVI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2494,2813,NA,Herbert and I went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our debts looking into our affairs leaving Margins and the like exemplary transactions and Time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing and I came of agein fulfilment of Herberts prediction that I should do so before I knew where I was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2815,2869,NA,Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2871,2986,NA,As he had nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnards Inn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2988,3200,NA,But we had looked forward to my oneandtwentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3202,3284,NA,I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my birthday was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3286,3465,NA,On the day before it I received an official note from Wemmick informing me that Mr Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3467,3621,NA,This convinced us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardians office a model of punctuality
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3623,3788,NA,In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissuepaper that I liked the look of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3790,3875,NA,But he said nothing respecting it and motioned me with a nod into my guardians room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3877,4017,NA,It was November and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimneypiece with his hands under his coattails
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4019,4072,NA,Well Pip said he I must call you Mr Pip today
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4074,4099,NA,Congratulations Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4101,4175,NA,We shook handshe was always a remarkably short shakerand I thanked him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4177,4218,NA,Take a chair Mr Pip said my guardian
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4220,4395,NA,As I sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots I felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4397,4560,NA,The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4562,4989,NA,Now my young friend my guardian began as if I were a witness in the box I am going to have a word or two with you If you please sir What do you suppose said Mr Jaggers bending forward to look at the ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceilingwhat do you suppose you are living at the rate of At the rate of sir At repeated Mr Jaggers still looking at the ceiling therateof
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4991,5100,NA,And then looked all round the room and paused with his pockethandkerchief in his hand halfway to his nose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5102,5230,NA,I had looked into my affairs so often that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5232,5299,NA,Reluctantly I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5301,5416,NA,This reply seemed agreeable to Mr Jaggers who said I thought so and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5418,5483,NA,Now I have asked  you  a question my friend said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5485,5629,NA,Have you anything to ask  me  Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions sir but I remember your prohibition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5631,5658,NA,Ask one said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5660,5713,NA,Is my benefactor to be made known to me today No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5715,5727,NA,Ask another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5729,5836,NA,Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon Waive that a moment said Mr Jaggers and ask another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5838,6031,NA,I looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry HaveIanything to receive sir On that Mr Jaggers said triumphantly I thought we should come to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6033,6086,NA,and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6088,6135,NA,Wemmick appeared handed it in and disappeared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6137,6193,NA,Now Mr Pip said Mr Jaggers attend if you please
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6195,6415,NA,You have been drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in Wemmicks cashbook but you are in debt of course I am afraid I must say yes sir You know you must say yes dont you said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6417,6545,NA,Yes sir I dont ask you what you owe because you dont know and if you did know you wouldnt tell me you would say less
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6547,6715,NA,Yes yes my friend cried Mr Jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of protesting its likely enough that you think you wouldnt but you would
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6717,6761,NA,Youll excuse me but I know better than you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6763,6805,NA,Now take this piece of paper in your hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6807,6822,NA,You have got it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6824,6833,NA,Very good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6835,6873,NA,Now unfold it and tell me what it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6875,6931,NA,This is a banknote said I for five hundred pounds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6933,7002,NA,That is a banknote repeated Mr Jaggers for five hundred pounds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7004,7049,NA,And a very handsome sum of money too I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7051,7098,NA,You consider it so How could I do otherwise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7100,7103,NA,Ah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7105,7147,NA,But answer the question said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7149,7162,NA,Undoubtedly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7164,7218,NA,You consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7220,7269,NA,Now that handsome sum of money Pip is your own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7271,7338,NA,It is a present to you on this day in earnest of your expectations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7340,7472,NA,And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the donor of the whole appears
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7474,7724,NA,That is to say you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter until you are in communication with the fountainhead and no longer with the mere agent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7726,7772,NA,As I have told you before I am the mere agent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7774,7827,NA,I execute my instructions and I am paid for doing so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7829,7912,NA,I think them injudicious but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7914,8049,NA,I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated when Mr Jaggers stopped me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8051,8274,NA,I am not paid Pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one and then gathered up his coattails as he had gathered up the subject and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8276,8389,NA,After a pause I hinted There was a question just now Mr Jaggers which you desired me to waive for a moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8391,8442,NA,I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8444,8465,NA,What is it said he
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8467,8601,NA,I might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8603,8751,NA,Is it likely I said after hesitating that my patron the fountainhead you have spoken of Mr Jaggers will soon there I delicately stopped
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8753,8788,NA,Will soon what asked Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8790,8833,NA,Thats no question as it stands you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8835,9126,NA,Will soon come to London said I after casting about for a precise form of words or summon me anywhere else Now here replied Mr Jaggers fixing me for the first time with his dark deepset eyes we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9128,9242,NA,What did I tell you then Pip You told me Mr Jaggers that it might be years hence when that person appeared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9244,9291,NA,Just so said Mr Jaggers thats my answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9293,9404,NA,As we looked full at one another I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9406,9560,NA,And as I felt that it came quicker and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9562,9620,NA,Do you suppose it will still be years hence Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9622,9940,NA,Mr Jaggers shook his headnot in negativing the question but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer itand the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention and were going to sneeze
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9942,10001,NA,Come said Mr Jaggers warming the backs of his legs with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,592,594,person,Joe

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,3249,3262,location,Little Britain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,8854,8859,location,London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,72,NA,h the backs of his warmed hands Ill be plain with you my friend Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,74,111,NA,Thats a question I must not be asked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,113,202,NA,Youll understand that better when I tell you its a question that might compromise  me 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,204,269,NA,Come Ill go a little further with you Ill say something more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,271,381,NA,He bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,383,503,NA,When that person discloses said Mr Jaggers straightening himself you and that person will settle your own affairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,505,582,NA,When that person discloses my part in this business will cease and determine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,584,669,NA,When that person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,671,704,NA,And thats all I have got to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,706,793,NA,We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes and looked thoughtfully at the floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,795,1096,NA,From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella that he resented this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to that scheme and would have nothing to do with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1098,1211,NA,When I raised my eyes again I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and was doing so still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1213,1305,NA,If that is all you have to say sir I remarked there can be nothing left for me to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1307,1403,NA,He nodded assent and pulled out his thiefdreaded watch and asked me where I was going to dine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1405,1447,NA,I replied at my own chambers with Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1449,1565,NA,As a necessary sequence I asked him if he would favour us with his company and he promptly accepted the invitation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1567,1745,NA,But he insisted on walking home with me in order that I might make no extra preparation for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had his hands to wash
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1747,1809,NA,So I said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1811,2042,NA,The fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket a thought had come into my head which had been often there before and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2044,2115,NA,He had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2117,2439,NA,He had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his hat and greatcoat ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safekey as an athletic exercise after business
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2441,2444,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2446,2491,NA,Wemmick said I I want to ask your opinion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2493,2530,NA,I am very desirous to serve a friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2532,2653,NA,Wemmick tightened his postoffice and shook his head as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2655,2800,NA,This friend I pursued is trying to get on in commercial life but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2802,2848,NA,Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2850,2915,NA,With money down said Wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2917,3114,NA,With  some  money down I replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at homewith  some  money down and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3116,3119,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3121,3272,NA,Pip said Wemmick I should like just to run over with you on my fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3274,3391,NA,Lets see theres London one Southwark two Blackfriars three Waterloo four Westminster five Vauxhall six
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3393,3492,NA,He had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his safekey on the palm of his hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3494,3543,NA,Theres as many as six you see to choose from
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3545,3763,NA,I dont understand you said I Choose your bridge Mr Pip returned Wemmick and take a walk upon your bridge and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge and you know the end of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3765,3869,NA,Serve a friend with it and you may know the end of it toobut its a less pleasant and profitable end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3871,3953,NA,I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after saying this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3955,4022,NA,This is very discouraging said I Meant to be so said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4024,4173,NA,Then is it your opinion I inquired with some little indignation that a man should never Invest portable property in a friend said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4175,4199,NA,Certainly he should not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4201,4335,NA,Unless he wants to get rid of the friendand then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4337,4462,NA,And that said I is your deliberate opinion Mr Wemmick That he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4464,4587,NA,Ah said I pressing him for I thought I saw him near a loophole here but would that be your opinion at Walworth Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4589,4671,NA,Pip he replied with gravity Walworth is one place and this office is another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4673,4731,NA,Much as the Aged is one person and Mr Jaggers is another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4733,4769,NA,They must not be confounded together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4771,4881,NA,My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4883,4981,NA,Very well said I much relieved then I shall look you up at Walworth you may depend upon it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4983,4986,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4988,5070,NA,Pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and personal capacity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5072,5181,NA,We had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardians ears to be the sharpest of the sharp
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5183,5306,NA,As he now appeared in his doorway towelling his hands Wemmick got on his greatcoat and stood by to snuff out the candles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5308,5432,NA,We all three went into the street together and from the doorstep Wemmick turned his way and Mr Jaggers and I turned ours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5434,5613,NA,I could not help wishing more than once that evening that Mr Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard Street or a Stinger or a Something or a Somebody to unbend his brows a little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5615,5788,NA,It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twentyfirst birthday that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5790,5923,NA,He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5925,6178,NA,And Mr Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because after he was gone Herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it he felt so dejected and guilty

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6196,6343,NA,Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr Wemmicks Walworth sentiments I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6345,6563,NA,On arriving before the battlements I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance I rang at the gate and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6565,6759,NA,My son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoons walk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6761,6803,NA,He is very regular in his walks is my son
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6805,6843,NA,Very regular in everything is my son
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6845,6956,NA,I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded and we went in and sat down by the fireside
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6958,7104,NA,You made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office I expect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7106,7114,NA,I nodded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7116,7120,NA,Hah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7122,7188,NA,I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7190,7203,NA,I nodded hard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7205,7226,NA,Yes so they tell me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7228,7252,NA,His business is the Law
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7254,7269,NA,I nodded harder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7271,7398,NA,Which makes it more surprising in my son said the old man for he was not brought up to the Law but to the WineCoopering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7400,7520,NA,Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr Jaggers I roared that name at him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7522,7654,NA,He threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner No to be sure youre right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7656,7753,NA,And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought I had made
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7755,7941,NA,As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making some other attempt to interest him I shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been the WineCoopering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7943,8122,NA,By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8124,8187,NA,No said the old gentleman the warehousing the warehousing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8189,8334,NA,First over yonder he appeared to mean up the chimney but I believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool and then in the City of London here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8336,8447,NA,However having an infirmityfor I am hard of hearing sir I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8449,8638,NA,Yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he went into the Law and he took charge of me and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8640,8773,NA,But returning to what you said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what I say is No to be sure youre right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8775,9087,NA,I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with JOHN upon it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9089,9207,NA,The old man following my eyes cried with great triumph My sons come home and we both went out to the drawbridge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9209,9366,NA,It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9368,9573,NA,The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge that I made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across and had presented me to Miss Skiffins a lady by whom he was accompanied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9575,9683,NA,Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in the postoffice branch of the service
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9685,9807,NA,She might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick and I judged her to stand possessed of portable property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9809,10001,NA,The cut of her dress from the waist upward both before and behind made her figure very like a boys kite and I might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,30,111,NA,But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow and showed a high regard for the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,113,402,NA,I was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle for on our going in and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney and disappeared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,404,633,NA,Presently another click came and another little door tumbled open with Miss Skiffins on it then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open then Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together and finally shut up together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,635,832,NA,On Wemmicks return from working these mechanical appliances I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them and he said Well you know theyre both pleasant and useful to the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,834,1098,NA,And by George sir its a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged Miss Skiffins and me And Mr Wemmick made them added Miss Skiffins with his own hands out of his own head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1100,1358,NA,While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property and see how the island looked in wintertime
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1360,1508,NA,Thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1510,1611,NA,Having thought of the matter with care I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1613,1738,NA,I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Herbert Pocket and I told him how we had first met and how we had fought
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1740,1897,NA,I glanced at Herberts home and at his character and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for those uncertain and unpunctual
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1899,2115,NA,I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them and that he might have done better without me and my expectations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2117,2381,NA,Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts retaliations or designs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2383,2853,NA,For all these reasons I told Wemmick and because he was my young companion and friend and I had a great affection for him I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him and therefore I sought advice from Wemmicks experience and knowledge of men and affairs how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present incomesay of a hundred a year to keep him in good hope and heartand gradually to buy him on to some small partnership
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2855,3049,NA,I begged Wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help must always be rendered without Herberts knowledge or suspicion and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3051,3243,NA,I wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying I cant help confiding in you though I know it must be troublesome to you but that is your fault in having ever brought me here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3245,3370,NA,Wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of start Well you know Mr Pip I must tell you one thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3372,3513,NA,This is devilish good of you Say youll help me to be good then said I Ecod replied Wemmick shaking his head thats not my trade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3515,3585,NA,Nor is this your tradingplace said I You are right he returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3587,3616,NA,You hit the nail on the head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3618,3712,NA,Mr Pip Ill put on my consideringcap and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3714,3770,NA,Skiffins thats her brother is an accountant and agent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3772,3812,NA,Ill look him up and go to work for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3814,3846,NA,I thank you ten thousand times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3848,4046,NA,On the contrary said he I thank you for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there  are  Newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4048,4174,NA,After a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4176,4354,NA,The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4356,4429,NA,It was no nominal meal that we were going to make but a vigorous reality
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4431,4759,NA,The Aged prepared such a haystack of buttered toast that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the topbar while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4761,4951,NA,The flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right moment of time and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4953,5187,NA,Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5189,5522,NA,I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffinss arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5524,5652,NA,We ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5654,5747,NA,The Aged especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe just oiled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5749,5995,NA,After a short pause of repose Miss Skiffinsin the absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoonswashed up the teathings in a trifling ladylike amateur manner that compromised none of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5997,6114,NA,Then she put on her gloves again and we drew round the fire and Wemmick said Now Aged Parent tip us the paper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6116,6293,NA,Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out that this was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6295,6472,NA,I wont offer an apology said Wemmick for he isnt capable of many pleasuresare you Aged P All right John all right returned the old man seeing himself spoken to
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6474,6589,NA,Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper said Wemmick and hell be as happy as a king
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6591,6742,NA,We are all attention Aged One All right John all right returned the cheerful old man so busy and so pleased that it really was quite charming
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6744,6892,NA,The Ageds reading reminded me of the classes at Mr Wopsles greataunts with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6894,7067,NA,As he wanted the candles close to him and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them he required as much watching as a powdermill
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7069,7190,NA,But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the Aged read on quite unconscious of his many rescues
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7192,7305,NA,Whenever he looked at us we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he resumed again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7307,7547,NA,As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side and as I sat in a shadowy corner I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr Wemmicks mouth powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffinss waist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7549,7822,NA,In course of time I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7824,8063,NA,Miss Skiffinss composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8065,8162,NA,By and by I noticed Wemmicks arm beginning to disappear again and gradually fading out of view
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8164,8214,NA,Shortly afterwards his mouth began to widen again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8216,8360,NA,After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8362,8501,NA,Instantly Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid it on the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8503,8721,NA,Taking the table to represent the path of virtue I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Ageds reading Wemmicks arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8723,8774,NA,At last the Aged read himself into a light slumber
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8776,8970,NA,This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a black bottle with a porcelaintopped cork representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8972,9085,NA,With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink including the Aged who was soon awake again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9087,9166,NA,Miss Skiffins mixed and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9168,9377,NA,Of course I knew better than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first which I did taking a cordial leave of the Aged and having passed a pleasant evening
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9379,9632,NA,Before a week was out I received a note from Wemmick dated Walworth stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9634,9836,NA,So I went out to Walworth again and yet again and yet again and I saw him by appointment in the City several times but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9838,10001,NA,The upshot was that we found a worthy young merchant or shippingbroker not long established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted capital and

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,337,386,NA,Miss Skiffinss brother conducted the negotiation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,388,444,NA,Wemmick pervaded it throughout but never appeared in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,446,553,NA,The whole business was so cleverly managed that Herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,555,869,NA,I never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty piece of news of his having fallen in with one Clarriker the young merchants name and of Clarrikers having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,871,1085,NA,Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so happy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1087,1366,NA,At length the thing being done and he having that day entered Clarrikers House and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1368,1444,NA,A great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my view
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1446,1570,NA,But before I proceed to narrate it and before I pass on to all the changes it involved I must give one chapter to Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1572,1636,NA,It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1638,1653,NA,Chapter XXXVIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1655,1792,NA,If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1794,1913,NA,O the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1915,2016,NA,Let my body be where it would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2018,2143,NA,The lady with whom Estella was placed Mrs Brandley by name was a widow with one daughter several years older than Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2145,2326,NA,The mother looked young and the daughter looked old the mothers complexion was pink and the daughters was yellow the mother set up for frivolity and the daughter for theology
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2328,2424,NA,They were in what is called a good position and visited and were visited by numbers of people
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2426,2604,NA,Little if any community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her and that she was necessary to them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2606,2689,NA,Mrs Brandley had been a friend of Miss Havishams before the time of her seclusion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2691,2821,NA,In Mrs Brandleys house and out of Mrs Brandleys house I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2823,2965,NA,The nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favour conduced to my distraction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2967,3135,NA,She made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3137,3343,NA,If I had been her secretary steward halfbrother poor relationif I had been a younger brother of her appointed husbandI could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3345,3596,NA,The privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers I know too certainly that it almost maddened me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3598,3626,NA,She had admirers without end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3628,3749,NA,No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them without that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3751,4021,NA,I saw her often at Richmond I heard of her often in town and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water there were picnics fête days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures through which I pursued herand they were all miseries to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4023,4185,NA,I never had one hours happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the fourandtwenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4187,4399,NA,Throughout this part of our intercourseand it lasted as will presently be seen for what I then thought a long timeshe habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4401,4527,NA,There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4529,4774,NA,Pip Pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond will you never take warning Of what Of me Warning not to be attracted by you do you mean Estella Do I mean
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4776,4821,NA,If you dont know what I mean you are blind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4823,5097,NA,I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind but for the reason that I always was restrainedand this was not the least of my miseriesby a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5099,5264,NA,My dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5266,5373,NA,At any rate said I I have no warning given me just now for you wrote to me to come to you this time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5375,5453,NA,Thats true said Estella with a cold careless smile that always chilled me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5455,5615,NA,After looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on to say The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5617,5673,NA,You are to take me there and bring me back if you will
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5675,5814,NA,She would rather I did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5816,5874,NA,Can you take me Can I take you Estella You can then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5876,5914,NA,The day after tomorrow if you please
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5916,5958,NA,You are to pay all charges out of my purse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5960,6182,NA,You hear the condition of your going And must obey said I This was all the preparation I received for that visit or for others like it Miss Havisham never wrote to me nor had I ever so much as seen her handwriting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6184,6346,NA,We went down on the next day but one and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6348,6554,NA,She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I last saw them together I repeat the word advisedly for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6556,6767,NA,She hung upon Estellas beauty hung upon her words hung upon her gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6769,6877,NA,From Estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6879,7006,NA,How does she use you Pip how does she use you she asked me again with her witchlike eagerness even in Estellas hearing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7008,7550,NA,But when we sat by her flickering fire at night she was most weird for then keeping Estellas hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a very spectre
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7552,7824,NA,I saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakenedI saw in this that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havishams revenge on men and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7826,7889,NA,I saw in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7891,8105,NA,Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8107,8218,NA,I saw in this that I too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while the prize was reserved for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8220,8383,NA,I saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardians declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8385,8623,NA,In a word I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes and always had had her before my eyes and I saw in this the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8625,8702,NA,The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8704,8824,NA,They were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8826,9193,NA,As I looked round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and thrown back to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9195,9562,NA,My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread and I saw it written as it were in the falls of the cobwebs from the centrepiece in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9564,9667,NA,It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Estella and Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9669,9719,NA,It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9721,9926,NA,We were seated by the fire as just now described and Miss Havisham still had Estellas arm drawn through her own and still clutched Estellas hand in hers when Estella gradually began to detach herself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9928,10001,NA,She had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather end

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,59,288,NA,What said Miss Havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired of me Only a little tired of myself replied Estella disengaging her arm and moving to the great chimneypiece where she stood looking down at the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,290,412,NA,Speak the truth you ingrate cried Miss Havisham passionately striking her stick upon the floor you are tired of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,414,493,NA,Estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down at the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,495,630,NA,Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a selfpossessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was almost cruel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,632,678,NA,You stock and stone exclaimed Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,680,872,NA,You cold cold heart What said Estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimneypiece and only moving her eyes do you reproach me for being cold
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,874,916,NA,You Are you not was the fierce retort
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,918,949,NA,You should know said Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,951,978,NA,I am what you have made me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,980,1083,NA,Take all the praise take all the blame take all the success take all the failure in short take me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1085,1217,NA,O look at her look at her cried Miss Havisham bitterly Look at her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1219,1511,NA,Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her Illustration At least I was no party to the compact said Estella for if I could walk and speak when it was made it was as much as I could do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1513,1536,NA,But what would you have
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1538,1596,NA,You have been very good to me and I owe everything to you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1598,1645,NA,What would you have Love replied the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1647,1660,NA,You have it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1662,1694,NA,I have not said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1696,1938,NA,Mother by adoption retorted Estella never departing from the easy grace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never yielding either to anger or tendernessmother by adoption I have said that I owe everything to you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1940,1969,NA,All I possess is freely yours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1971,2031,NA,All that you have given me is at your command to have again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2033,2060,NA,Beyond that I have nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2062,2165,NA,And if you ask me to give you what you never gave me my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2167,2237,NA,Did I never give her love cried Miss Havisham turning wildly to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2239,2365,NA,Did I never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all times and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2367,2474,NA,Let her call me mad let her call me mad Why should I call you mad returned Estella I of all people
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2476,2553,NA,Does any one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2555,2635,NA,Does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half as well as I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2637,2843,NA,I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up into your face when your face was strange and frightened me Soon forgotten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2845,2865,NA,moaned Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2867,2889,NA,Times soon forgotten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2891,2975,NA,No not forgotten retorted Estellanot forgotten but treasured up in my memory
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2977,3022,NA,When have you found me false to your teaching
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3024,3072,NA,When have you found me unmindful of your lessons
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3074,3188,NA,When have you found me giving admission here she touched her bosom with her hand to anything that you excluded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3190,3296,NA,Be just to me So proud so proud moaned Miss Havisham pushing away her grey hair with both her hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3298,3325,NA,Who taught me to be proud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3327,3343,NA,returned Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3345,3385,NA,Who praised me when I learnt my lesson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3387,3451,NA,So hard so hard moaned Miss Havisham with her former action
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3453,3479,NA,Who taught me to be hard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3481,3497,NA,returned Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3499,3539,NA,Who praised me when I learnt my lesson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3541,3636,NA,But to be proud and hard to  me  Miss Havisham quite shrieked as she stretched out her arms
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3638,3852,NA,Estella Estella Estella to be proud and hard to  me  Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at the fire again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3854,3995,NA,I cannot think said Estella raising her eyes after a silence why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3997,4048,NA,I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4050,4103,NA,I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4105,4167,NA,I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4169,4234,NA,Would it be weakness to return my love exclaimed Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4236,4408,NA,But yes yes she would call it so I begin to think said Estella in a musing way after another moment of calm wonder that I almost understand how this comes about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4410,4770,NA,If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your faceif you had done that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and angry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4772,4893,NA,Miss Havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4895,5378,NA,Or said Estellawhich is a nearer caseif you had taught her from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had blighted you and would else blight herif you had done this and then for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5380,5481,NA,Miss Havisham sat listening or it seemed so for I could not see her face but still made no answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5483,5539,NA,So said Estella I must be taken as I have been made
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5541,5620,NA,The success is not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5622,5743,NA,Miss Havisham had settled down I hardly knew how upon the floor among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5745,5898,NA,I took advantage of the momentI had sought one from the firstto leave the room after beseeching Estellas attention to her with a movement of my hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5900,5998,NA,When I left Estella was yet standing by the great chimneypiece just as she had stood throughout
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6000,6121,NA,Miss Havishams grey hair was all adrift upon the ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6123,6277,NA,It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about the ruined garden
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6279,6594,NA,When I at last took courage to return to the room I found Estella sitting at Miss Havishams knee taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6596,6749,NA,Afterwards Estella and I played at cards as of yoreonly we were skilful now and played French gamesand so the evening wore away and I went to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6751,6803,NA,I lay in that separate building across the courtyard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6805,6905,NA,It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House and sleep refused to come near me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6907,6943,NA,A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6945,7151,NA,She was on this side of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the halfopened door of the dressingroom in the dressingroom in the room overhead in the room beneatheverywhere
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7153,7324,NA,At last when the night was slow to creep on towards two oclock I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that I must get up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7326,7504,NA,I therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7506,7648,NA,But I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle for I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner making a low cry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7650,7711,NA,I followed her at a distance and saw her go up the staircase
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7713,7866,NA,She carried a bare candle in her hand which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room and was a most unearthly object by its light
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7868,8109,NA,Standing at the bottom of the staircase I felt the mildewed air of the feastchamber without seeing her open the door and I heard her walking there and so across into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low cry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8111,8273,NA,After a time I tried in the dark both to get out and to go back but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8275,8429,NA,During the whole interval whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase I heard her footstep saw her light pass above and heard her ceaseless low cry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8431,8637,NA,Before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between her and Estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8639,8800,NA,Nor did Miss Havishams manner towards Estella in anywise change except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8802,8920,NA,It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting Bentley Drummles name upon it or I would very gladly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8922,9285,NA,On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobodys agreeing with anybody else the presiding Finch called the Grove to order forasmuch as Mr Drummle had not yet toasted a lady which according to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brutes turn to do that day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9287,9433,NA,I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us that might easily be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9435,9583,NA,What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to Estella Estella who said I Never you mind retorted Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9585,9644,NA,Estella of where said I You are bound to say of where
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9646,9670,NA,Which he was as a Finch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9672,9767,NA,Of Richmond gentlemen said Drummle putting me out of the question and a peerless beauty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9769,9830,NA,Much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9832,9851,NA,I whispered Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9853,9937,NA,I know that lady said Herbert across the table when the toast had been honoured
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9939,9963,NA, Do  you said Drummle

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,10,34,NA, Do  you said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,36,47,NA, O  Lord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,49,524,NA,This was the only retortexcept glass or crockerythat the heavy creature was capable of making but I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable Finchs impudence to come down to that Grovewe always talked about coming down to that Grove as a neat Parliamentary turn of expressiondown to that Grove proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,526,592,NA,Mr Drummle upon this starting up demanded what I meant by that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,594,680,NA,Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,682,814,NA,Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood after this was a question on which the Finches were divided
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,816,999,NA,The debate upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honourable members told six more during the discussion that they believed  they  knew where  they  were to be found
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1001,1307,NA,However it was decided at last the Grove being a Court of Honour that if Mr Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honour of her acquaintance Mr Pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a Finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1309,1536,NA,Next day was appointed for the production lest our honour should take cold from delay and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estellas hand that she had had the honour of dancing with him several times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1538,1708,NA,This left me no course but to regret that I had been betrayed into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the idea that I was to be found anywhere
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1710,1919,NA,Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1921,1973,NA,I tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1975,2143,NA,For I cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should show any favour to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below the average
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2145,2343,NA,To the present moment I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2345,2494,NA,No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favoured but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2496,2632,NA,It was easy for me to find out and I did soon find out that Drummle had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2634,2729,NA,A little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and I crossed one another every day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2731,2958,NA,He held on in a dull persistent way and Estella held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now scarcely remembering who he was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2960,3072,NA,The Spider as Mr Jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait however and had the patience of his tribe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3074,3262,NA,Added to that he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness which sometimes did him good servicealmost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3264,3406,NA,So the Spider doggedly watching Estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3408,3679,NA,At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then where Estella had outshone all other beauties this blundering Drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration on her part that I resolved to speak to her concerning him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3681,3830,NA,I took the next opportunity which was when she was waiting for Mrs Blandley to take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3832,3908,NA,I was with her for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3910,3966,NA,Are you tired Estella Rather Pip You should be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3968,4065,NA,Say rather I should not be for I have my letter to Satis House to write before I go to sleep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4067,4141,NA,Recounting tonights triumph said I Surely a very poor one Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4143,4160,NA,What do you mean
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4162,4195,NA,I didnt know there had been any
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4197,4368,NA,Estella said I do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is looking over here at us Why should I look at him returned Estella with her eyes on me instead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4370,4572,NA,What is there in that fellow in the corner yonderto use your wordsthat I need look at Indeed that is the very question I want to ask you said I For he has been hovering about you all night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4574,4689,NA,Moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied Estella with a glance towards him hover about a lighted candle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4691,4714,NA,Can the candle help it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4716,4766,NA,No I returned but cannot the Estella help it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4768,4820,NA,Well said she laughing after a moment perhaps
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4822,4825,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4827,4845,NA,Anything you like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4847,4878,NA,But Estella do hear me speak

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7636,7656,NA,Dear boy I done it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7658,7707,NA,I tried to collect my thoughts but I was stunned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7709,7898,NA,Throughout I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him even now I could not separate his voice from those voices though those were loud and his was silent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7900,7944,NA,Where will you put me he asked presently

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8704,8888,NA,Nothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come to me and I held it there in my keeping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8890,9097,NA,If I had loved him instead of abhorring him if I had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance it could have been no worse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9099,9221,NA,On the contrary it would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9223,9350,NA,My first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen from without and then to close and make fast the doors
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9352,9505,NA,While I did so he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when I saw him thus engaged I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9507,9584,NA,It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his leg
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9586,9789,NA,When I had gone into Herberts room and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held I asked him if he would go to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9791,9876,NA,He said yes but asked me for some of my gentlemans linen to put on in the morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9878,10001,NA,I brought it out and laid it ready for him and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,8,NA,dnight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,10,160,NA,I got away from him without knowing how I did it and mended the fire in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,162,358,NA,For an hour or more I remained too stunned to think and it was not until I began to think that I began fully to know how wrecked I was and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,360,645,NA,Miss Havishams intentions towards me all a mere dream Estella not designed for me I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience a sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first smarts I had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,647,866,NA,But sharpest and deepest pain of allit was for the convict guilty of I knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking and hanged at the Old Bailey door that I had deserted Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,868,1079,NA,I would not have gone back to Joe now I would not have gone back to Biddy now for any consideration simply I suppose because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1081,1241,NA,No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity but I could never never undo what I had done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1243,1299,NA,In every rage of wind and rush of rain I heard pursuers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1301,1380,NA,Twice I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1382,1501,NA,With these fears upon me I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this mans approach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1503,1590,NA,That for weeks gone by I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1592,1683,NA,That these likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had drawn nearer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1685,1824,NA,That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word and with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1826,2111,NA,Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2113,2289,NA,Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a halfformed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2291,2403,NA,This dilated until it filled the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2405,2496,NA,He had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and lowering in his sleep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2498,2576,NA,But he was asleep and quietly too though he had a pistol lying on the pillow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2578,2704,NA,Assured of this I softly removed the key to the outside of his door and turned it on him before I again sat down by the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2706,2761,NA,Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2763,3012,NA,When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3014,3071,NA,THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIPS EXPECTATIONS
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3073,3083,NA,Chapter XL
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3085,3308,NA,It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure so far as I could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought pressing on me when I awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3310,3385,NA,The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was selfevident
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3387,3469,NA,It could not be done and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3471,3707,NA,True I had no Avenger in my service now but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an animated ragbag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3709,3912,NA,They both had weak eyes which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3914,4047,NA,Not to get up a mystery with these people I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4049,4152,NA,This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4154,4286,NA,Not stumbling on the means after all I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4288,4409,NA,Now in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4411,4607,NA,As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there but eluded my touch in silence I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly telling him of the incident on the way back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4609,4830,NA,The wind being as fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4832,5076,NA,It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms so lighting my candle at the watchmans and leaving him standing at the door I examined them carefully including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5078,5141,NA,All was quiet and assuredly no other man was in those chambers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5143,5450,NA,It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on that night of all nights in the year and I asked the watchman on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5452,5504,NA,Yes he said at different times of the night three
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5506,5604,NA,One lived in Fountain Court and the other two lived in the Lane and he had seen them all go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5606,5846,NA,Again the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came upstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5848,5964,NA,The night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5966,6101,NA,Besides them three gentlemen that I have named I dont call to mind another since about eleven oclock when a stranger asked for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6103,6125,NA,My uncle I muttered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6127,6132,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6134,6158,NA,You saw him sir Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6160,6199,NA,Oh yes Likewise the person with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6201,6218,NA,Person with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6220,6230,NA,I repeated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6232,6291,NA,I judged the person to be with him returned the watchman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6293,6404,NA,The person stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this way when he took this way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6406,6427,NA,What sort of person
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6429,6591,NA,The watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working person to the best of his belief he had a dustcoloured kind of clothes on under a dark coat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6593,6710,NA,The watchman made more light of the matter than I did and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6712,6869,NA,When I had got rid of him which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6871,7275,NA,Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apartas for instance some diner out or diner at home who had not gone near this watchmans gate might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep thereand my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the waystill joined they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7277,7389,NA,I lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning and fell into a doze before it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7391,7460,NA,I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7462,7754,NA,As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight I dozed again now waking up uneasily with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now making thunder of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7756,7843,NA,All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation nor could I do so yet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7845,7880,NA,I had not the power to attend to it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7882,7963,NA,I was greatly dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7965,8043,NA,As to forming any plan for the future I could as soon have formed an elephant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8045,8411,NA,When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning all of a leaden hue when I walked from room to room when I sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to appear I thought how miserable I was but hardly knew why or how long I had been so or on what day of the week I made the reflection or even who I was that made it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8413,8581,NA,At last the old woman and the niece came inthe latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broomand testified surprise at sight of me and the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8583,8724,NA,To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8726,8930,NA,Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream or sleepwaking I found myself sitting by the fire again waiting forHimto come to breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8932,8974,NA,By and by his door opened and he came out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8976,9072,NA,I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him and I thought he had a worse look by daylight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9074,9176,NA,I do not even know said I speaking low as he took his seat at the table by what name to call you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9178,9217,NA,I have given out that you are my uncle

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9629,9708,NA,He answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some profession

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9854,9973,NA,Yes dear boy When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had you any one with you With me

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,550,736,NA,It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up a knife gave it a flourish and with the words And what I done is worked out and paid for fell to at his breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,738,842,NA,He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions were uncouth noisy and greedy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,844,1068,NA,Some of his teeth had failed him since I saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1070,1252,NA,If I had begun with any appetite he would have taken it away and I should have sat much as I didrepelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily looking at the cloth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1254,1374,NA,Im a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal but I always was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1376,1471,NA,If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber I might ha got into lighter trouble
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1473,1504,NA,Similarly I must have my smoke
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1506,1668,NA,When I was first hired out as shepherd tother side the world its my belief I should ha turned into a molloncollymad sheep myself if I hadnt a had my smoke
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1670,1869,NA,As he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the breast of the peacoat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negrohead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1871,1964,NA,Having filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket were a drawer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1966,2193,NA,Then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and went through his favourite action of holding out both his hands for mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2195,2318,NA,And this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed at his pipeand this is the gentleman what I made

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2383,2442,NA,All I stiplate is to stand by and look at you dear boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2444,2573,NA,I released my hands as soon as I could and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2575,2752,NA,What I was chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as I heard his hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron grey hair at the sides
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2754,2861,NA,I mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets there mustnt be no mud on  his  boots
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2863,2988,NA,My gentleman must have horses Pip Horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5929,6083,NA,Dear boy he returned theres disguising wigs can be bought for money and theres hair powder and spectacles and black clothesshorts and what not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6085,6166,NA,Others has done it safe afore and what others has done afore others can do agen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6168,6245,NA,As to the where and how of living dear boy give me your own opinions on it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6247,6350,NA,You take it smoothly now said I but you were very serious last night when you swore it was Death
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6352,6550,NA,And so I swear it is Death said he putting his pipe back in his mouth and Death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and its serious that you should fully understand it to be so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6552,6584,NA,What then when thats once done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6586,6595,NA,Here I am
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6597,6650,NA,To go back now ud be as bad as to stand groundworse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6652,6721,NA,Besides Pip Im here because Ive meant it by you years and years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6723,6867,NA,As to what I dare Im a old bird now as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and Im not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6869,6997,NA,If theres Death hid inside of it there is and let him come out and Ill face him and then Ill believe in him and not afore
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6999,7047,NA,And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7049,7185,NA,Once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7187,7368,NA,It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when Herbert returned whom I expected in two or three days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7370,7573,NA,That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with him out of the question was plain to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7575,7793,NA,But it was by no means so plain to Mr Provis I resolved to call him by that name who reserved his consent to Herberts participation until he should have seen him and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7795,7926,NA,And even then dear boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket well have him on his oath
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7928,8172,NA,To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to state what I never quite established but this I can say that I never knew him put it to any other use
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8174,8419,NA,The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8421,8635,NA,On this first occasion of his producing it I recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8637,8814,NA,As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of I next discussed with him what dress he should wear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8816,9011,NA,He cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9013,9206,NA,It was with considerable difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmers and we arranged that he should cut his hair close and wear a little powder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9208,9350,NA,Lastly as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9352,9552,NA,It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9554,9651,NA,He was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone and was on no account to open the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9653,9924,NA,There being to my knowledge a respectable lodginghouse in Essex Street the back of which looked into the Temple and was almost within hail of my windows I first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle Mr Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9926,10001,NA,I then went from shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to th

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,30,110,NA,This business transacted I turned my face on my own account to Little Britain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,112,207,NA,Mr Jaggers was at his desk but seeing me enter got up immediately and stood before his fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,209,242,NA,Now Pip said he be careful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,244,269,NA,I will sir I returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,271,334,NA,For coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,336,404,NA,Dont commit yourself said Mr Jaggers and dont commit any one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,406,428,NA,You understandany one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,430,502,NA,Dont tell me anything I dont want to know anything I am not curious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,504,549,NA,Of course I saw that he knew the man was come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,551,641,NA,I merely want Mr Jaggers said I to assure myself that what I have been told is true
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,643,708,NA,I have no hope of its being untrue but at least I may verify it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,710,728,NA,Mr Jaggers nodded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,730,876,NA,But did you say told or informed he asked me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in a listening way at the floor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,878,924,NA,Told would seem to imply verbal communication
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,926,1002,NA,You cant have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1004,1039,NA,I will say informed Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1041,1047,NA,Good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1049,1211,NA,I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me That is the man said Mr Jaggers in New South Wales
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1213,1267,NA,And only he said I And only he said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1269,1418,NA,I am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1420,1569,NA,As you say Pip returned Mr Jaggers turning his eyes upon me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger I am not at all responsible for that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1571,1639,NA,And yet it looked so like it sir I pleaded with a downcast heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1641,1738,NA,Not a particle of evidence Pip said Mr Jaggers shaking his head and gathering up his skirts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1740,1795,NA,Take nothing on its looks take everything on evidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1797,1820,NA,Theres no better rule
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1822,1908,NA,I have no more to say said I with a sigh after standing silent for a little while
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1910,1962,NA,I have verified my information and theres an end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1964,2175,NA,And Magwitchin New South Waleshaving at last disclosed himself said Mr Jaggers you will comprehend Pip how rigidly throughout my communication with you I have always adhered to the strict line of fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2177,2246,NA,There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2248,2469,NA,You are quite aware of that Quite sir I communicated to Magwitchin New South Waleswhen he first wrote to mefrom New South Walesthe caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2471,2513,NA,I also communicated to him another caution
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2515,2629,NA,He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2631,2918,NA,I cautioned him that I must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2920,3019,NA,I gave Magwitch that caution said Mr Jaggers looking hard at me I wrote it to New South Wales
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3021,3055,NA,He guided himself by it no doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3057,3282,NA,No doubt said I I have been informed by Wemmick pursued Mr Jaggers still looking hard at me that he has received a letter under date Portsmouth from a colonist of the name of Purvis or Or Provis I suggested
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3284,3309,NA,Or Provisthank you Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3311,3333,NA,Perhaps it  is  Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3335,3364,NA,Perhaps you know its Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3366,3402,NA,Yes said I You know its Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3404,3541,NA,A letter under date Portsmouth from a colonist of the name of Provis asking for the particulars of your address on behalf of Magwitch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3543,3608,NA,Wemmick sent him the particulars I understand by return of post
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3610,3747,NA,Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitchin New South Wales It came through Provis I replied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3749,3825,NA,Good day Pip said Mr Jaggers offering his hand glad to have seen you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3827,4092,NA,In writing by post to Magwitchin New South Walesor in communicating with him through Provis have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4094,4177,NA,Goodday Pip We shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4179,4474,NA,I turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open and to force out of their swollen throats O what a man he is Wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4476,4602,NA,I went straight back to the Temple where I found the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negrohead in safety
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4604,4672,NA,Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home and he put them on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4674,4765,NA,Whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what he had worn before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4767,4858,NA,To my thinking there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4860,4974,NA,The more I dressed him and the better I dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4976,5266,NA,This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5268,5531,NA,The influences of his solitary hutlife were upon him besides and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5533,6200,NA,In all his ways of sitting and standing and eating and drinkingof brooding about in a highshouldered reluctant styleof taking out his great hornhandled jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his foodof lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy pannikinsof chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the most of an allowance and then drying his fingerends on it and then swallowing itin these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day there was Prisoner Felon Bondsman plain as plain could be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6202,6314,NA,It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and I had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6316,6610,NA,But I can compare the effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6612,6686,NA,It was abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6688,6785,NA,Words cannot tell what a sense I had at the same time of the dreadful mystery that he was to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6787,7136,NA,When he fell asleep of an evening with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast I would sit and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7138,7395,NA,Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7397,7610,NA,Once I actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else I possessed and enlist for India as a private soldier
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7612,7775,NA,I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the rain always rushing by
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7777,7945,NA,A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that he would be were no small addition to my horrors
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7947,8287,NA,When he was not asleep or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of cards of his owna game that I never saw before or since and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the tablewhen he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to read to himForeign language dear boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8289,8569,NA,While I complied he not comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor and I would see him between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8571,8821,NA,The imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more wretched than I pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8823,8884,NA,This is written of I am sensible as if it had lasted a year
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8886,8911,NA,It lasted about five days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8913,9015,NA,Expecting Herbert all the time I dared not go out except when I took Provis for an airing after dark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9017,9233,NA,At length one evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn outfor my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreamsI was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9235,9359,NA,Provis who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise I made and in an instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9361,9367,NA,Quiet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9369,9382,NA,Its Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9384,9485,NA,I said and Herbert came bursting in with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9487,9569,NA,Handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again how are you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9571,9609,NA,I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9611,9675,NA,Why so I must have been for you have grown quite thin and pale
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9677,9694,NA,Handel myHalloa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9696,9714,NA,I beg your pardon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9716,9799,NA,He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by seeing Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9801,9932,NA,Provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9934,10001,NA,Herbert my dear friend said I shutting the double doors while

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,75,NA,Herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has happened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,77,103,NA,This isa visitor of mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,105,235,NA,Its all right dear boy said Provis coming forward with his little clasped black book and then addressing himself to Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,237,264,NA,Take it in your right hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,266,336,NA,Lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in any way sumever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,338,346,NA,Kiss it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,348,391,NA,Do so as he wishes it I said to Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,393,559,NA,So Herbert looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and Provis immediately shaking hands with him said Now youre on your oath you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,561,642,NA,And never believe me on mine if Pip shant make a gentleman on you Chapter XLI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,644,813,NA,In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire and I recounted the whole of the secret
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,815,962,NA,Enough that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herberts face and not least among them my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,964,1103,NA,What would alone have set a division between that man and us if there had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1105,1362,NA,Saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since his returnon which point he began to hold forth to Herbert the moment my revelation was finishedhe had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1364,1528,NA,His boast that he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1530,1679,NA,And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite established in his own mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1681,1856,NA,Though lookee here Pips comrade he said to Herbert after having discoursed for some time I know very well that once since I come backfor half a minuteIve been low
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1858,1899,NA,I said to Pip I knowed as I had been low
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1901,1942,NA,But dont you fret yourself on that score
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1944,2065,NA,I aint made Pip a gentleman and Pip aint agoing to make you a gentleman not fur me not to know whats due to ye both
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2067,2155,NA,Dear boy and Pips comrade you two may count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2157,2293,NA,Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness muzzled I am at the present time muzzled I ever will be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2295,2418,NA,Herbert said Certainly but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2420,2569,NA,We were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat late
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2571,2670,NA,It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street and saw him safely in at his own dark door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2672,2780,NA,When it closed upon him I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of his arrival
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2782,2967,NA,Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in bringing him back and I looked about me now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2969,3186,NA,Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3188,3302,NA,The few who were passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3304,3379,NA,Nobody had come out at the gate with us nobody went in at the gate with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3381,3656,NA,As I crossed by the fountain I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived before going up the stairs Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3658,3762,NA,Herbert received me with open arms and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3764,3888,NA,When he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the question What was to be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3890,4369,NA,The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had stoodfor he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slateI say his chair remaining where it had stood Herbert unconsciously took it but next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4371,4497,NA,He had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron neither had I occasion to confess my own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4499,4557,NA,We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4559,4641,NA,What said I to Herbert when he was safe in another chairwhat is to be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4643,4723,NA,My poor dear Handel he replied holding his head I am too stunned to think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4725,4769,NA,So was I Herbert when the blow first fell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4771,4800,NA,Still something must be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4802,4900,NA,He is intent upon various new expenseshorses and carriages and lavish appearances of all kinds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4902,4929,NA,He must be stopped somehow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4931,5009,NA,You mean that you cant accept How can I I interposed as Herbert paused
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5011,5024,NA,Think of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5026,5038,NA,Look at him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5040,5085,NA,An involuntary shudder passed over both of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5087,5186,NA,Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is Herbert that he is attached to me strongly attached to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5188,5256,NA,Was there ever such a fate My poor dear Handel Herbert repeated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5258,5372,NA,Then said I after all stopping short here never taking another penny from him think what I owe him already
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5374,5520,NA,Then again I am heavily in debtvery heavily for me who have now no expectationsand I have been bred to no calling and I am fit for nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5522,5562,NA,Well well well Herbert remonstrated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5564,5591,NA,Dont say fit for nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5593,5611,NA,What am I fit for
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5613,5686,NA,I know only one thing that I am fit for and that is to go for a soldier
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5688,5802,NA,And I might have gone my dear Herbert but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5804,5920,NA,Of course I broke down there and of course Herbert beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5922,5987,NA,Anyhow my dear Handel said he presently soldiering wont do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5989,6139,NA,If you were to renounce this patronage and these favours I suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6141,6213,NA,Not very strong that hope if you went soldiering Besides its absurd
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6215,6282,NA,You would be infinitely better in Clarrikers house small as it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6284,6332,NA,I am working up towards a partnership you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6334,6345,NA,Poor fellow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6347,6383,NA,He little suspected with whose money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6385,6430,NA,But there is another question said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6432,6501,NA,This is an ignorant determined man who has long had one fixed idea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6503,6603,NA,More than that he seems to me I may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce character
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6605,6631,NA,I know he is I returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6633,6682,NA,Let me tell you what evidence I have seen of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6684,6781,NA,And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative of that encounter with the other convict
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6783,6824,NA,See then said Herbert think of this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6826,6903,NA,He comes here at the peril of his life for the realisation of his fixed idea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6905,7060,NA,In the moment of realisation after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7062,7124,NA,Do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7126,7212,NA,I have seen it Herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night of his arrival
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7214,7309,NA,Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7311,7403,NA,Then you may rely upon it said Herbert that there would be great danger of his doing it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7405,7523,NA,That is his power over you as long as he remains in England and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7525,7762,NA,I was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard myself in some sort as his murderer that I could not rest in my chair but began pacing to and fro
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7764,7915,NA,I said to Herbert meanwhile that even if Provis were recognised and taken in spite of himself I should be wretched as the cause however innocently
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7917,8107,NA,Yes even though I was so wretched in having him at large and near me and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8109,8171,NA,But there was no staving off the question What was to be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8173,8259,NA,The first and the main thing to be done said Herbert is to get him out of England
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8261,8572,NA,You will have to go with him and then he may be induced to go But get him where I will could I prevent his coming back My good Handel is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless here than elsewhere
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8574,8685,NA,If a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his life now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8687,8813,NA,There again said I stopping before Herbert with my open hands held out as if they contained the desperation of the case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8815,8842,NA,I know nothing of his life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8844,9061,NA,It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9063,9168,NA,Herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and fro together studying the carpet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9170,9279,NA,Handel said Herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him do you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9281,9287,NA,Fully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9289,9391,NA,Surely you would too if you were in my place And you feel convinced that you must break with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9393,9576,NA,Herbert can you ask me And you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from throwing it away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9578,9661,NA,Then you must get him out of England before you stir a finger to extricate yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9663,9756,NA,That done extricate yourself in Heavens name and well see it out together dear old boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9758,9846,NA,It was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again with only that done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9848,9928,NA,Now Herbert said I with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9930,9965,NA,There is but one way that I know of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9967,9994,NA,I must ask him point blank

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,69,153,NA,For he had said on taking leave of Herbert that he would come to breakfast with us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,155,195,NA,With this project formed we went to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,197,370,NA,I had the wildest dreams concerning him and woke unrefreshed I woke too to recover the fear which I had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned transport
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,372,402,NA,Waking I never lost that fear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,404,489,NA,He came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat down to his meal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,491,661,NA,He was full of plans for his gentlemans coming out strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocketbook which he had left in my possession
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,663,848,NA,He considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to look out at once for a fashionable crib near Hyde Park in which he could have a shakedown
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,850,1108,NA,When he had made an end of his breakfast and was wiping his knife on his leg I said to him without a word of preface After you were gone last night I told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1110,1123,NA,You remember
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1125,1215,NA,Remember said he I think so We want to know something about that manand about you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1217,1317,NA,It is strange to know no more about either and particularly you than I was able to tell last night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1319,1416,NA,Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more Well he said after consideration
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1418,1494,NA,Youre on your oath you know Pips comrade Assuredly replied Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1496,1541,NA,As to anything I say you know he insisted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1543,1596,NA,The oath applies to all I understand it to do so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1598,1615,NA,And lookee here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1617,1678,NA,Wotever I done is worked out and paid for he insisted again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1680,1690,NA,So be it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1692,1876,NA,He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1878,2082,NA,He put it back again stuck his pipe in a buttonhole of his coat spread a hand on each knee and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments looked round at us and said what follows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2084,2096,NA,Chapter XLII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2098,2125,NA,Dear boy and Pips comrade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2127,2196,NA,I am not agoing fur to tell you my life like a song or a storybook

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2477,2533,NA,Ive been done everything to pretty wellexcept hanged

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2587,2737,NA,Ive been carted here and carted there and put out of this town and put out of that town and stuck in the stocks and whipped and worried and drove
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2739,2800,NA,Ive no more notion where I was born than you haveif so much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2802,2880,NA,I first become aware of myself down in Essex a thieving turnips for my living
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2882,2979,NA,Summun had run away from mea mana tinkerand hed took the fire with him and left me wery cold

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7226,7388,NA,I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert and put the book by but we neither of us said anything and both looked at Provis as he stood smoking by the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7390,7403,NA,Chapter XLIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7405,7494,NA,Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7496,7804,NA,Why should I loiter on my road to compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coachoffice with the state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty and the returned transport whom I harboured
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7806,7931,NA,The road would be none the smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not be helped nor I extenuated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7933,8079,NA,A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8175,8461,NA,That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of him neither of the two could know much better than I and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8463,8555,NA,Never had I breathed and never would I breatheor so I resolveda word of Estella to Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8557,8653,NA,But I said to Herbert that before I could go abroad I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8655,8741,NA,This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8949,9040,NA,Not as usual I said for she had never yet gone there without me when was she coming back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9042,9212,NA,There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9214,9349,NA,I could make nothing of this except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it and I went home again in complete discomfiture
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9351,9587,NA,Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home I always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havishams
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9589,9848,NA,In the mean time Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation or whether I who had never yet been abroad should propose an expedition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9850,9919,NA,We both knew that I had but to propose anything and he would consent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9921,10001,NA,We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be though

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,165,275,NA,Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone and Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,277,432,NA,I was to be absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,434,602,NA,It occurred to me then and as I afterwards found to Herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that pretenceas to make purchases or the like
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,604,901,NA,Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havishams I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist like a beggar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,903,1065,NA,When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly ride whom should I see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand to look at the coach but Bentley Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1067,1124,NA,As he pretended not to see me I pretended not to see him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1126,1289,NA,It was a very lame pretence on both sides the lamer because we both went into the coffeeroom where he had just finished his breakfast and where I ordered mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1291,1380,NA,It was poisonous to me to see him in the town for I very well knew why he had come there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1382,1722,NA,Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form I sat at my table while he stood before the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1724,1799,NA,By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1801,1848,NA,And I got up determined to have my share of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1850,1986,NA,I had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to stir the fire but still pretended not to know him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1988,2021,NA,Is this a cut said Mr Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2023,2068,NA,Oh said I poker in hand its you is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2070,2083,NA,How do you do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2085,2135,NA,I was wondering who it was who kept the fire off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2137,2280,NA,With that I poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side by side with Mr Drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2282,2368,NA,You have just come down said Mr Drummle edging me a little away with his shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2370,2430,NA,Yes said I edging  him  a little away with  my  shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2432,2461,NA,Beastly place said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2463,2498,NA,Your part of the country I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2500,2517,NA,Yes I assented
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2519,2603,NA,I am told its very like your Shropshire Not in the least like it said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2605,2751,NA,Here Mr Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine and then Mr Drummle looked at my boots and I looked at his Have you been here long
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2753,2805,NA,I asked determined not to yield an inch of the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2807,2900,NA,Long enough to be tired of it returned Drummle pretending to yawn but equally determined
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2902,2960,NA,Do you stay here long Cant say answered Mr Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2962,3268,NA,Do you Cant say said I I felt here through a tingling in my blood that if Mr Drummles shoulder had claimed another hairs breadth of room I should have jerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim Mr Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3270,3290,NA,He whistled a little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3292,3362,NA,So did I Large tract of marshes about here I believe said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3364,3368,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3370,3473,NA,What of that said I Mr Drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said Oh and laughed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3475,3538,NA,Are you amused Mr Drummle No said he not particularly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3540,3579,NA,I am going out for a ride in the saddle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3581,3626,NA,I mean to explore those marshes for amusement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3628,3671,NA,Outoftheway villages there they tell me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3673,3723,NA,Curious little publichousesand smithiesand that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3725,3817,NA,Waiter Yes sir Is that horse of mine ready Brought round to the door sir I say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3819,3837,NA,Look here you sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3839,3888,NA,The lady wont ride today the weather wont do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3890,3967,NA,Very good sir And I dont dine because Im going to dine at the ladys
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3969,3985,NA,Very good sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3987,4268,NA,Then Drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his greatjowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so exasperated me that I felt inclined to take him in my arms as the robber in the storybook is said to have taken the old lady and seat him on the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4270,4385,NA,One thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief came neither of us could relinquish the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4387,4514,NA,There we stood well squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our hands behind us not budging an inch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4516,4703,NA,The horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table Drummles was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin I nodded we both stood our ground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4705,4753,NA,Have you been to the Grove since said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4755,4830,NA,No said I I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4832,4910,NA,Was that when we had a difference of opinion Yes I replied very shortly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4912,4923,NA,Come come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4925,4973,NA,They let you off easily enough sneered Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4975,5012,NA,You shouldnt have lost your temper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5014,5017,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5019,5090,NA,Drummle said I you are not competent to give advice on that subject
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5092,5188,NA,When I lose my temper not that I admit having done so on that occasion I dont throw glasses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5190,5210,NA,I do said Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5212,5308,NA,After glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of smouldering ferocity I said Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5310,5391,NA,Drummle I did not seek this conversation and I dont think it an agreeable one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5393,5491,NA,I am sure its not said he superciliously over his shoulder I dont think anything about it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5493,5602,NA,And therefore I went on with your leave I will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5604,5718,NA,Quite my opinion said Drummle and what I should have suggested myself or donemore likelywithout suggesting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5720,5746,NA,But dont lose your temper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5748,5785,NA,Havent you lost enough without that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5787,5858,NA,What do you mean sir Waiter said Drummle by way of answering me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5860,5881,NA,The waiter reappeared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5883,5902,NA,Look here you sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5904,6000,NA,You quite understand that the young lady dont ride today and that I dine at the young ladys
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6002,6017,NA,Quite so sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6019,6277,NA,When the waiter had felt my fastcooling teapot with the palm of his hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out Drummle careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6279,6547,NA,Choking and boiling as I was I felt that we could not go a word further without introducing Estellas name which I could not endure to hear him utter and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were no one present and forced myself to silence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6549,6871,NA,How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but for the incursion of three thriving farmerslaid on by the waiter I thinkwho came into the coffeeroom unbuttoning their greatcoats and rubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we were obliged to give way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6873,7003,NA,I saw him through the window seizing his horses mane and mounting in his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7005,7117,NA,I thought he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth which he had forgotten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7119,7505,NA,A man in a dustcoloured dress appeared with what was wantedI could not have said from where whether from the inn yard or the street or where notand as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his head towards the coffeeroom windows the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7507,7812,NA,Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no or after all to touch the breakfast I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered never to have seen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7814,7826,NA,Chapter XLIV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7828,8036,NA,In the room where the dressingtable stood and where the waxcandles burnt on the wall I found Miss Havisham and Estella Miss Havisham seated on a settee near the fire and Estella on a cushion at her feet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8038,8092,NA,Estella was knitting and Miss Havisham was looking on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8094,8168,NA,They both raised their eyes as I went in and both saw an alteration in me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8170,8217,NA,I derived that from the look they interchanged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8219,8347,NA,And what wind said Miss Havisham blows you here Pip Though she looked steadily at me I saw that she was rather confused
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8349,8594,NA,Estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and then going on I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8596,8733,NA,Miss Havisham said I I went to Richmond yesterday to speak to Estella and finding that some wind had blown  her  here I followed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8735,8880,NA,Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down I took the chair by the dressingtable which I had often seen her occupy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8882,8968,NA,With all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural place for me that day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8970,9065,NA,What I had to say to Estella Miss Havisham I will say before you presentlyin a few moments
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9067,9118,NA,It will not surprise you it will not displease you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9120,9220,NA,I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9222,9341,NA,I could see in the action of Estellas fingers as they worked that she attended to what I said but she did not look up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9343,9377,NA,I have found out who my patron is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9379,9489,NA,It is not a fortunate discovery and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune anything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9491,9539,NA,There are reasons why I must say no more of that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9541,9576,NA,It is not my secret but anothers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9578,9717,NA,As I was silent for a while looking at Estella and considering how to go on Miss Havisham repeated It is not your secret but anothers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9719,10001,NA,Well When you first caused me to be brought here Miss Havisham when I belonged to the village over yonder that I wish I had never left I suppose I did really come here as any other chance boy might have comeas a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,11,81,NA,Ay Pip replied Miss Havisham steadily nodding her head you did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,83,110,NA,And that Mr Jaggers Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,112,221,NA,Jaggers said Miss Havisham taking me up in a firm tone had nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,223,300,NA,His being my lawyer and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,302,381,NA,He holds the same relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,383,453,NA,Be that as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,455,546,NA,Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,548,705,NA,But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in at least you led me on said I Yes she returned again nodding steadily I let you go on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,707,920,NA,Was that kind Who am I cried Miss Havisham striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in surprisewho am I for Gods sake that I should be kind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,922,990,NA,It was a weak complaint to have made and I had not meant to make it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,992,1046,NA,I told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1048,1076,NA,Well well well she said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1078,1248,NA,What else I was liberally paid for my old attendance here I said to soothe her in being apprenticed and I have asked these questions only for my own information
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1250,1314,NA,What follows has another and I hope more disinterested purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1316,1490,NA,In humouring my mistake Miss Havisham you punishedpractised onperhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention without offenceyour selfseeking relations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1492,1498,NA,I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1500,1526,NA,Why they would have it so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1528,1540,NA,So would you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1542,1648,NA,What has been my history that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1650,1674,NA,You made your own snares
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1677,1696,NA,I  never made them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1698,1802,NA,Waiting until she was quiet againfor this too flashed out of her in a wild and sudden wayI went on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1804,1933,NA,I have been thrown among one family of your relations Miss Havisham and have been constantly among them since I went to London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1935,2001,NA,I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2003,2332,NA,And I should be false and base if I did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you deeply wrong both Mr Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of anything designing or mean
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2334,2377,NA,They are your friends said Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2379,2559,NA,They made themselves my friends said I when they supposed me to have superseded them and when Sarah Pocket Miss Georgiana and Mistress Camilla were not my friends I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2561,2651,NA,This contrasting of them with the rest seemed I was glad to see to do them good with her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2653,2815,NA,She looked at me keenly for a little while and then said quietly What do you want for them Only said I that you would not confound them with the others
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2817,2897,NA,They may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same nature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2899,3143,NA,Still looking at me keenly Miss Havisham repeated What do you want for them I am not so cunning you see I said in answer conscious that I reddened a little as that I could hide from you even if I desired that I do want something
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3145,3380,NA,Miss Havisham if you would spare the money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge I could show you how Why must it be done without his knowledge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3382,3473,NA,she asked settling her hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3475,3602,NA,Because said I I began the service myself more than two years ago without his knowledge and I dont want to be betrayed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3604,3659,NA,Why I fail in my ability to finish it I cannot explain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3661,3727,NA,It is a part of the secret which is another persons and not mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3729,3797,NA,She gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3799,4066,NA,After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me againat first vacantlythen with a gradually concentrating attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4068,4100,NA,All this time Estella knitted on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4102,4333,NA,When Miss Havisham had fixed her attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue What else Estella said I turning to her now and trying to command my trembling voice you know I love you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4335,4382,NA,You know that I have loved you long and dearly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4384,4523,NA,She raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4525,4592,NA,I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4594,4650,NA,I should have said this sooner but for my long mistake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4652,4717,NA,It induced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4719,4802,NA,While I thought you could not help yourself as it were I refrained from saying it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4804,4826,NA,But I must say it now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4828,4920,NA,Preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going Estella shook her head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4922,4973,NA,I know said I in answer to that actionI know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4975,5030,NA,I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5032,5115,NA,I am ignorant what may become of me very soon how poor I may be or where I may go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5117,5134,NA,Still I love you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5136,5194,NA,I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5196,5279,NA,Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her head again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5281,5521,NA,It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham horribly cruel to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5523,5546,NA,But I think she did not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5548,5622,NA,I think that in the endurance of her own trial she forgot mine Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5624,5879,NA,I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she sat looking by turns at Estella and at me It seems said Estella very calmly that there are sentiments fanciesI dont know how to call themwhich I am not able to comprehend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5881,5965,NA,When you say you love me I know what you mean as a form of words but nothing more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5967,6024,NA,You address nothing in my breast you touch nothing there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6026,6062,NA,I dont care for what you say at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6064,6114,NA,I have tried to warn you of this now have I not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6116,6151,NA,I said in a miserable manner Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6153,6157,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6159,6221,NA,But you would not be warned for you thought I did not mean it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6223,6293,NA,Now did you not think so I thought and hoped you could not mean it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6295,6341,NA,You so young untried and beautiful Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6343,6370,NA,Surely it is not in Nature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6372,6408,NA,It is in  my  nature she returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6410,6497,NA,And then she added with a stress upon the words It is in the nature formed within me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6499,6576,NA,I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6578,6595,NA,I can do no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6597,6770,NA,Is it not true said I that Bentley Drummle is in town here and pursuing you It is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6772,6861,NA,That you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with you this very day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6863,7074,NA,She seemed a little surprised that I should know it but again replied Quite true You cannot love him Estella Her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily What have I told you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7076,7180,NA,Do you still think in spite of it that I do not mean what I say You would never marry him Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7182,7270,NA,She looked towards Miss Havisham and considered for a moment with her work in her hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7272,7314,NA,Then she said Why not tell you the truth

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7350,7510,NA,I dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better than I could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7512,7652,NA,When I raised my face again there was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havishams that it impressed me even in my passionate hurry and grief

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8012,8334,NA,Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly though he has not loved you as long as I Take him and I can bear it better for your sake My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,995,1063,NA,I held her hand to my lips some lingering moments and so I left her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1065,1339,NA,But ever afterwards I rememberedand soon afterwards with stronger reasonthat while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of Miss Havisham her hand still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1341,1359,NA,All done all gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1361,1488,NA,So much was done and gone that when I went out at the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when I went in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1490,1596,NA,For a while I hid myself among some lanes and bypaths and then struck off to walk all the way to London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1598,1846,NA,For I had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1848,1897,NA,It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1899,2101,NA,Pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the Middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the Temple was close by the riverside through Whitefriars
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2103,2237,NA,I was not expected till tomorrow but I had my keys and if Herbert were gone to bed could get to bed myself without disturbing him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2239,2496,NA,As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the Temple was closed and as I was very muddy and weary I did not take it ill that the nightporter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2498,2536,NA,To help his memory I mentioned my name

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2870,2973,NA,I opened it the watchman holding up his light and read inside in Wemmicks writing DONT GO HOME
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2975,2986,NA,Chapter XLV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2988,3173,NA,Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning I made the best of my way to Fleet Street and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3175,3417,NA,In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3419,3730,NA,It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a despotic monster of a fourpost bedstead in it straddling over the whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little washingstand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3732,4177,NA,As I had asked for a nightlight the chamberlain had brought me in before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous daysan object like the ghost of a walkingcane which instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly wideawake pattern on the walls
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4179,4345,NA,When I had got into bed and lay there footsore weary and wretched I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4347,4418,NA,And thus in the gloom and death of the night we stared at one another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4420,4440,NA,What a doleful night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4442,4475,NA,How anxious how dismal how long
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4477,4789,NA,There was an inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head I thought what a number of bluebottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying by for next summer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4791,5003,NA,This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my facea disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5005,5127,NA,When I had lain awake a little while those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5129,5271,NA,The closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little washingstand ticked and one guitarstring played occasionally in the chest of drawers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5273,5414,NA,At about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written DONT GO HOME
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5416,5511,NA,Whatever nightfancies and nightnoises crowded on me they never warded off this DONT GO HOME
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5513,5591,NA,It plaited itself into whatever I thought of as a bodily pain would have done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5593,5802,NA,Not long before I had read in the newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been found in the morning weltering in blood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5804,6109,NA,It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6111,6377,NA,But all this time why I was not to go home and what had happened at home and when I should go home and whether Provis was safe at home were questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6379,6670,NA,Even when I thought of Estella and how we had parted that day forever and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and tones and the action of her fingers while she knittedeven then I was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution Dont go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6672,6786,NA,When at last I dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6788,6928,NA,Imperative mood present tense Do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do not ye or you go home let not them go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6930,7168,NA,Then potentially I may not and I cannot go home and I might not could not would not and should not go home until I felt that I was going distracted and rolled over on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7170,7386,NA,I had left directions that I was to be called at seven for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be taken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7388,7542,NA,It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7544,7602,NA,The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight oclock
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7604,7860,NA,The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the Aged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7862,7921,NA,An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7923,7954,NA,Halloa Mr Pip said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7956,8024,NA,You did come home then Yes I returned but I didnt go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8026,8072,NA,Thats all right said he rubbing his hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8074,8139,NA,I left a note for you at each of the Temple gates on the chance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8141,8168,NA,Which gate did you come to
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8170,8180,NA,I told him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8182,8392,NA,Ill go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes said Wemmick its a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it because you dont know when it may be put in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8394,8430,NA,Im going to take a liberty with you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8433,8526,NA,Would  you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P I said I should be delighted to do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8528,8703,NA,Then you can go about your work Mary Anne said Wemmick to the little servant which leaves us to ourselves dont you see Mr Pip he added winking as she disappeared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8705,8873,NA,I thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse proceeded in a low tone while I toasted the Ageds sausage and he buttered the crumb of the Ageds roll
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8875,8948,NA,Now Mr Pip you know said Wemmick you and I understand one another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8950,9065,NA,We are in our private and personal capacities and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before today
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9067,9100,NA,Official sentiments are one thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9102,9124,NA,We are extra official
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9126,9146,NA,I cordially assented
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9148,9262,NA,I was so very nervous that I had already lighted the Ageds sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9264,9491,NA,I accidentally heard yesterday morning said Wemmick being in a certain place where I once took youeven between you and me its as well not to mention names when avoidable Much better not said I I understand you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9493,10001,NA,I heard there by chance yesterday morning said Wemmick that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not unpossessed of portable propertyI dont know who it may really bewe wont name this person Not necessary said I Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations and not quite irrespective of the government expense In watching his face I made quite a firework of the Ageds

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,97,170,NA,By disappearing from such place and being no more heard of thereabouts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,172,247,NA,From which said Wemmick conjectures had been raised and theories formed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,249,358,NA,I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court Temple had been watched and might be watched again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,360,477,NA,By whom said I I wouldnt go into that said Wemmick evasively it might clash with official responsibilities
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,479,556,NA,I heard it as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,558,601,NA,I dont tell it you on information received
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,603,614,NA,I heard it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,616,733,NA,He took the toastingfork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth the Ageds breakfast neatly on a little tray
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,735,960,NA,Previous to placing it before him he went into the Ageds room with a clean white cloth and tied the same under the old gentlemans chin and propped him up and put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,962,1134,NA,Then he placed his breakfast before him with great care and said All right aint you Aged P To which the cheerful Aged replied All right John my boy all right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1136,1341,NA,As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be considered invisible I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1343,1525,NA,This watching of me at my chambers which I have once had reason to suspect I said to Wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1527,1554,NA,Wemmick looked very serious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1556,1610,NA,I couldnt undertake to say that of my own knowledge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1612,1663,NA,I mean I couldnt undertake to say it was at first
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1665,1731,NA,But it either is or it will be or its in great danger of being
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1733,1937,NA,As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much as he could and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did I could not press him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1939,2139,NA,But I told him after a little meditation over the fire that I would like to ask him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he deemed right and sure that his course would be right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2141,2324,NA,He paused in his breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirtsleeves his notion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me once to put my question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2326,2398,NA,You have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is Compeyson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2400,2430,NA,He answered with one other nod
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2432,2446,NA,Is he living
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2448,2461,NA,One other nod
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2463,2480,NA,Is he in London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2482,2600,NA,He gave me one other nod compressed the postoffice exceedingly gave me one last nod and went on with his breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2602,2748,NA,Now said Wemmick questioning being over which he emphasised and repeated for my guidance I come to what I did after hearing what I heard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2750,2845,NA,I went to Garden Court to find you not finding you I went to Clarrikers to find Mr Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2847,2894,NA,And him you found said I with great anxiety
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2896,2912,NA,And him I found
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2914,3198,NA,Without mentioning any names or going into any details I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybodyTom Jack or Richardbeing about the chambers or about the immediate neighbourhood he had better get Tom Jack or Richard out of the way while you were out of the way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3200,3406,NA,He would be greatly puzzled what to do He  was  puzzled what to do not the less because I gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom Jack or Richard too far out of the way at present
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3408,3440,NA,Mr Pip Ill tell you something
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3442,3531,NA,Under existing circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3533,3559,NA,Dont break cover too soon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3561,3570,NA,Lie close
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3572,3644,NA,Wait till things slacken before you try the open even for foreign air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3646,3720,NA,I thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what Herbert had done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3722,3725,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3727,3813,NA,Herbert said Wemmick after being all of a heap for half an hour struck out a plan
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3815,3930,NA,He mentioned to me as a secret that he is courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden Pa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3932,4062,NA,Which Pa having been in the Purser line of life lies abed in a bowwindow where he can see the ships sail up and down the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4064,4118,NA,You are acquainted with the young lady most probably
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4120,4516,NA,Not personally said I The truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good and that when Herbert had first proposed to present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her acquaintance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4518,4951,NA,When I had begun to advance Herberts prospects by stealth I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews and thus although I was assured that I had risen in Claras esteem and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert I had never seen her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4953,5010,NA,However I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5012,5332,NA,The house with the bowwindow said Wemmick being by the riverside down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich and being kept it seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let Mr Herbert put it to me what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom Jack or Richard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5334,5397,NA,Now I thought very well of it for three reasons Ill give you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5399,5424,NA,That is to say  Firstly 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5426,5528,NA,Its altogether out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5531,5540,NA,Secondly 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5542,5655,NA,Without going near it yourself you could always hear of the safety of Tom Jack or Richard through Mr Herbert

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5668,5811,NA,After a while and when it might be prudent if you should want to slip Tom Jack or Richard on board a foreign packetboat there he isready
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5813,5913,NA,Much comforted by these considerations I thanked Wemmick again and again and begged him to proceed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5915,5925,NA,Well sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5927,6117,NA,Mr Herbert threw himself into the business with a will and by nine oclock last night he housed Tom Jack or Richardwhichever it may beyou and I dont want to knowquite successfully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6119,6257,NA,At the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover and in fact he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6259,6474,NA,Now another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6476,6616,NA,This diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason I recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6618,6670,NA,It brings in more confusion and you want confusion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6672,6766,NA,Wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and began to get his coat on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6768,7006,NA,And now Mr Pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves I have probably done the most I can do but if I can ever do morefrom a Walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal capacityI shall be glad to do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7008,7026,NA,Heres the address
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7028,7225,NA,There can be no harm in your going here tonight and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom Jack or Richard before you go homewhich is another reason for your not going home last night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7227,7276,NA,But after you have gone home dont go back here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7278,7441,NA,You are very welcome I am sure Mr Pip his hands were now out of his sleeves and I was shaking them and let me finally impress one important point upon you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7443,7579,NA,He laid his hands upon my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7581,7618,NA,You dont know what may happen to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7620,7671,NA,Dont let anything happen to the portable property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7673,7756,NA,Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point I forbore to try
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7758,7803,NA,Times up said Wemmick and I must be off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7805,7900,NA,If you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark thats what I should advise

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8250,8291,NA,Goodbye Aged Parent in a cheery shout
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8293,8360,NA,All right John all right my boy piped the old man from within
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8362,8501,NA,I soon fell asleep before Wemmicks fire and the Aged and I enjoyed one anothers society by falling asleep before it more or less all day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8503,8649,NA,We had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it drowsily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8651,8860,NA,When it was quite dark I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast and I inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall that Miss Skiffins was expected

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8876,9054,NA,Eight oclock had struck before I got into the air that was scented not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the longshore boatbuilders and mast oar and block makers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9056,9290,NA,All that waterside region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to me and when I struck down by the river I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to find
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9292,9416,NA,It was called Mill Pond Bank Chinkss Basin and I had no other guide to Chinkss Basin than the Old Green Copper Ropewalk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9418,9841,NA,It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of shipbuilders and shipbreakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber how many ropewalks that were not the Old Green Copper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9843,9980,NA,After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it I came unexpectedly round a corner upon Mill Pond Bank

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,444,667,NA,Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bowwindow not baywindow which is another thing I looked at the plate upon the door and read there Mrs Whimple
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,669,778,NA,That being the name I wanted I knocked and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,780,884,NA,She was immediately deposed however by Herbert who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,886,1362,NA,It was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region and I found myself looking at him much as I looked at the cornercupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the chimneypiece and the coloured engravings on the wall representing the death of Captain Cook a shiplaunch and his Majesty King George the Third in a state coachmans wig leatherbreeches and topboots on the terrace at Windsor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1364,1452,NA,All is well Handel said Herbert and he is quite satisfied though eager to see you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1454,1581,NA,My dear girl is with her father and if youll wait till she comes down Ill make you known to her and then well go upstairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1584,1603,NA,Thats  her father
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1605,1711,NA,I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1713,1800,NA,I am afraid he is a sad old rascal said Herbert smiling but I have never seen him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1802,1821,NA,Dont you smell rum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1823,1842,NA,He is always at it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1844,1934,NA,At rum said I Yes returned Herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1936,2026,NA,He persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room and serving them out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2028,2093,NA,He keeps them on shelves over his head and  will  weigh them all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2095,2135,NA,His room must be like a chandlers shop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2137,2220,NA,While he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and then died away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2222,2316,NA,What else can be the consequence said Herbert in explanation if he  will  cut the cheese
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2318,2448,NA,A man with the gout in his right handand everywhere elsecant expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2450,2524,NA,He seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious roar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2526,2668,NA,To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs Whimple said Herbert for of course people in general wont stand that noise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2670,2704,NA,A curious place Handel isnt it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2706,2772,NA,It was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2774,2778,NA,Mrs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2780,2925,NA,Whimple said Herbert when I told him so is the best of housewives and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2927,3022,NA,For Clara has no mother of her own Handel and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3024,3110,NA,Surely thats not his name Herbert No no said Herbert thats my name for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3112,3134,NA,His name is Mr Barley
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3136,3301,NA,But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3303,3692,NA,Herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at Hammersmith and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs Whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion ever since
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3694,3915,NA,It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout Rum and Pursers stores
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3917,4236,NA,As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barleys sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door opened and a very pretty slight darkeyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket and presented blushing as Clara
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4238,4384,NA,She really was a most charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that truculent Ogre Old Barley had pressed into his service
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4386,4556,NA,Look here said Herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little heres poor Claras supper served out every night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4558,4654,NA,Heres her allowance of bread and heres her slice of cheese and heres her rumwhich I drink
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4656,4725,NA,This is Mr Barleys breakfast for tomorrow served out to be cooked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4727,4858,NA,Two muttonchops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4860,4951,NA,Its stewed up together and taken hot and its a nice thing for the gout I should think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4953,5499,NA,There was something so natural and winning in Claras resigned way of looking at these stores in detail as Herbert pointed them out and something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herberts embracing arm and something so gentle in her so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank by Chinkss Basin and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk with Old Barley growling in the beamthat I would not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert for all the money in the pocketbook I had never opened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5501,5738,NA,I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5740,5811,NA,Upon this Clara said to Herbert Papa wants me darling and ran away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5813,5873,NA,There is an unconscionable old shark for you said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5875,5976,NA,What do you suppose he wants now Handel I dont know said I Something to drink Thats it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5978,6040,NA,cried Herbert as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6042,6101,NA,He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6103,6164,NA,Wait a moment and youll hear Clara lift him up to take some
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6166,6180,NA,There he goes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6182,6229,NA,Another roar with a prolonged shake at the end
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6231,6298,NA,Now said Herbert as it was succeeded by silence hes drinking
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6300,6395,NA,Now said Herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more hes down again on his back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6397,6482,NA,Clara returned soon afterwards and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6484,6694,NA,As we passed Mr Barleys door he was heard hoarsely muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the following Refrain in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse Ahoy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6696,6735,NA,Bless your eyes heres old Bill Barley
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6737,6776,NA,Heres old Bill Barley bless your eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6778,6837,NA,Heres old Bill Barley on the flat of his back by the Lord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6839,6948,NA,Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder heres your old Bill Barley bless your eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6950,6966,NA,Ahoy Bless you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6968,7243,NA,In this strain of consolation Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together Often while it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7245,7407,NA,In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and airy and in which Mr Barley was less audible than below I found Provis comfortably settled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7409,7631,NA,He expressed no alarm and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was softenedindefinably for I could not have said how and could never afterwards recall how when I tried but certainly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7633,7776,NA,The opportunity that the days rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7778,7907,NA,For anything I knew his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7909,8061,NA,Therefore when Herbert and I sat down with him by his fire I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmicks judgment and sources of information
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8063,8129,NA,Ay ay dear boy he answered with a grave nod Jaggers knows
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8131,8242,NA,Then I have talked with Wemmick said I and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8244,8625,NA,This I did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and I told him how Wemmick had heard in Newgate prison whether from officers or prisoners I could not say that he was under some suspicion and that my chambers had been watched how Wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time and my keeping away from him and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8627,8767,NA,I added that of course when the time came I should go with him or should follow close upon him as might be safest in Wemmicks judgment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8769,8969,NA,What was to follow that I did not touch upon neither indeed was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind now that I saw him in that softer condition and in declared peril for my sake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8971,9161,NA,As to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9163,9228,NA,He could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9230,9312,NA,His coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a venture
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9314,9427,NA,He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9429,9614,NA,Herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmicks suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9616,9721,NA,We are both good watermen Handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9723,9862,NA,No boat would then be hired for the purpose and no boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance is worth saving
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9864,10001,NA,Never mind the season dont you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs and were in the

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,263,411,NA,We agreed that it should be carried into execution and that Provis should never recognise us if we came below Bridge and rowed past Mill Pond Bank
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,413,559,NA,But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1631,1729,NA,When we got to the foot of the stairs I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1731,1794,NA,He replied certainly not and that the lodger was Mr Campbell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1796,2007,NA,He also explained that the utmost known of Mr Campbell there was that he Herbert had Mr Campbell consigned to him and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2009,2165,NA,So when we went into the parlour where Mrs Whimple and Clara were seated at work I said nothing of my own interest in Mr Campbell but kept it to myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2167,2408,NA,When I had taken leave of the pretty gentle darkeyed girl and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love I felt as if the Old Green Copper Ropewalk had grown quite a different place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2410,2599,NA,Old Barley might be as old as the hills and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinkss Basin to fill it to overflowing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2601,2676,NA,And then I thought of Estella and of our parting and went home very sadly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2678,2740,NA,All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2742,2869,NA,The windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by Provis were dark and still and there was no lounger in Garden Court
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2871,2999,NA,I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms but I was quite alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3001,3121,NA,Herbert coming to my bedside when he came infor I went straight to bed dispirited and fatiguedmade the same report
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3123,3298,NA,Opening one of the windows after that he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3300,3337,NA,Next day I set myself to get the boat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3339,3464,NA,It was soon done and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3466,3559,NA,Then I began to go out as for training and practice sometimes alone sometimes with Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3561,3667,NA,I was often out in cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3669,3778,NA,At first I kept above Blackfriars Bridge but as the hours of the tide changed I took towards London Bridge
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3780,3925,NA,It was Old London Bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3927,4073,NA,But I knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool and down to Erith
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4075,4235,NA,The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards the east come down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4237,4384,NA,Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4386,4486,NA,Still I knew that there was cause for alarm and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4488,4612,NA,Once received it is a haunting idea how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me it would be hard to calculate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4614,4685,NA,In short I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4687,4893,NA,Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards Clara
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4895,5068,NA,But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly silently and surely to take him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5070,5083,NA,Chapter XLVII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5085,5130,NA,Some weeks passed without bringing any change
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5132,5174,NA,We waited for Wemmick and he made no sign
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5176,5373,NA,If I had never known him out of Little Britain and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle I might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him as I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5375,5482,NA,My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5484,5653,NA,Even I myself began to know the want of money I mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5655,5807,NA,But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5809,6059,NA,Therefore I had sent him the unopened pocketbook by Herbert to hold in his own keeping and I felt a kind of satisfactionwhether it was a false kind or a true I hardly knowin not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6061,6144,NA,As the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella was married
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6146,6351,NA,Fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a conviction I avoided the newspapers and begged Herbert to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6353,6471,NA,Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds how do I know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6473,6585,NA,Why did you who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year last month last week
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6587,6772,NA,It was an unhappy life that I lived and its one dominant anxiety towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a range of mountains never disappeared from my view
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6774,6808,NA,Still no new cause for fear arose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6810,7125,NA,Let me start from my bed as I would with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as I would with dread for Herberts returning step at night lest it should be fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil newsfor all that and much more to like purpose the round of things went on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7127,7269,NA,Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense I rowed about in my boat and waited waited waited as I best could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7271,7526,NA,There were states of the tide when having been down the river I could not get back through the eddychafed arches and starlings of old London Bridge then I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7528,7649,NA,I was not averse to doing this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the waterside people there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7651,7723,NA,From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7725,7805,NA,One afternoon late in the month of February I came ashore at the wharf at dusk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7807,7892,NA,I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide and had turned with the tide
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7894,8036,NA,It had been a fine bright day but had become foggy as the sun dropped and I had had to feel my way back among the shipping pretty carefully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8038,8112,NA,Both in going and returning I had seen the signal in his window All well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8114,8337,NA,As it was a raw evening and I was cold I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple I thought I would afterwards go to the play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8339,8500,NA,The theatre where Mr Wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that waterside neighbourhood it is nowhere now and to that theatre I resolved to go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8502,8627,NA,I was aware that Mr Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama but on the contrary had rather partaken of its decline
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8629,8767,NA,He had been ominously heard of through the playbills as a faithful Black in connection with a little girl of noble birth and a monkey
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8769,8905,NA,And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an outrageous hat all over bells
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8907,9326,NA,I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chophouse where there were maps of the world in porterpot rims on every halfyard of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knivesto this day there is scarcely a single chophouse within the Lord Mayors dominions which is not geographicaland wore out the time in dozing over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9328,9376,NA,By and by I roused myself and went to the play
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9378,9742,NA,There I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majestys servicea most excellent man though I could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places and not quite so loose in otherswho knocked all the little mens hats over their eyes though he was very generous and brave and who wouldnt hear of anybodys paying taxes though he was very patriotic
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9744,10001,NA,He had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in the cloth and on that property married a young person in bedfurniture with great rejoicings the whole population of Portsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub thei

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,63,NA,ir own hands and shake everybody elses and sing Fill fill
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,65,759,NA,A certain darkcomplexioned Swab however who wouldnt fill or do anything else that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the boatswain to be as black as his figurehead proposed to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually done the Swab family having considerable political influence that it took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldnt confute with what he had overheard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,761,1091,NA,This led to Mr Wopsles who had never been heard of before coming in with a star and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the Admiralty to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot and that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack as a slight acknowledgment of his public services
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1093,1285,NA,The boatswain unmanned for the first time respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack and then cheering up and addressing Mr Wopsle as Your Honour solicited permission to take him by the fin
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1287,1507,NA,Mr Wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe and from that corner surveying the public with a discontented eye became aware of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1509,1917,NA,The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime in the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1919,2464,NA,But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistanceon account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughters heart by purposely falling upon the object in a floursack out of the firstfloor windowsummoned a sententious Enchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after an apparently violent journey proved to be Mr Wopsle in a highcrowned hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2466,2657,NA,The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various colours he had a good deal of time on his hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2659,2773,NA,And I observed with great surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2775,2967,NA,There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr Wopsles eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused that I could not make it out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2969,3087,NA,I sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watchcase and still I could not make it out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3089,3209,NA,I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him waiting for me near the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3211,3296,NA,How do you do said I shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3298,3354,NA,I saw that you saw me Saw you Mr Pip he returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3356,3381,NA,Yes of course I saw you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3383,3531,NA,But who else was there Who else It is the strangest thing said Mr Wopsle drifting into his lost look again and yet I could swear to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3533,3596,NA,Becoming alarmed I entreated Mr Wopsle to explain his meaning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3598,3760,NA,Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there said Mr Wopsle going on in the same lost way I cant be positive yet I think I should
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3762,3892,NA,Involuntarily I looked round me as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3894,3897,NA,Oh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3899,3937,NA,He cant be in sight said Mr Wopsle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3939,3969,NA,He went out before I went off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3971,3984,NA,I saw him go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3986,4069,NA,Having the reason that I had for being suspicious I even suspected this poor actor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4071,4125,NA,I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4127,4196,NA,Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4198,4348,NA,I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you Mr Pip till I saw that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a ghost
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4350,4543,NA,My former chill crept over me again but I was resolved not to speak yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4545,4616,NA,Of course I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4618,4677,NA,I dare say you wonder at me Mr Pip indeed I see you do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4679,4704,NA,But it is so very strange
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4706,4755,NA,Youll hardly believe what I am going to tell you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4757,4837,NA,I could hardly believe it myself if you told me Indeed said I No indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4839,5050,NA,Mr Pip you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day when you were quite a child and I dined at Gargerys and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended I remember it very well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5052,5280,NA,And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that we joined in it and that Gargery took you on his back and that I took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could I remember it all very well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5282,5328,NA,Better than he thoughtexcept the last clause
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5330,5523,NA,And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5525,5549,NA,I see it all before me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5551,5901,NA,And that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes with the torchlight shining on their facesI am particular about thatwith the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us Yes said I I remember all that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5903,5968,NA,Then Mr Pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5970,5999,NA,I saw him over your shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6001,6009,NA,Steady
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6011,6020,NA,I thought
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6022,6160,NA,I asked him then Which of the two do you suppose you saw The one who had been mauled he answered readily and Ill swear I saw him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6162,6216,NA,The more I think of him the more certain I am of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6218,6321,NA,This is very curious said I with the best assumption I could put on of its being nothing more to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6323,6344,NA,Very curious indeed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6346,6520,NA,I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeysons having been behind me like a ghost
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6522,6857,NA,For if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was in those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had found him at my elbow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6859,7033,NA,I could not doubt either that he was there because I was there and that however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us danger was always near and active
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7035,7098,NA,I put such questions to Mr Wopsle as When did the man come in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7100,7173,NA,He could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7175,7375,NA,It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7377,7395,NA,How was he dressed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7397,7461,NA,Prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought in black
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7463,7493,NA,Was his face at all disfigured
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7495,7514,NA,No he believed not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7516,7710,NA,I believed not too for although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7712,7894,NA,When Mr Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I extract and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening we parted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7896,7984,NA,It was between twelve and one oclock when I reached the Temple and the gates were shut
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7986,8033,NA,No one was near me when I went in and went home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8035,8102,NA,Herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8104,8249,NA,But there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8251,8362,NA,As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the Castle I made this communication by letter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8364,8453,NA,I wrote it before I went to bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8455,8526,NA,Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8528,8755,NA,And we were very cautious indeedmore cautious than before if that were possibleand I for my part never went near Chinkss Basin except when I rowed by and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8757,8771,NA,Chapter XLVIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8773,8873,NA,The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8875,9195,NA,I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and undecided where to dine I had strolled up into Cheapside and was strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9197,9255,NA,It was Mr Jaggerss hand and he passed it through my arm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9257,9322,NA,As we are going in the same direction Pip we may walk together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9324,9419,NA,Where are you bound for For the Temple I think said I Dont you know said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9421,9551,NA,Well I returned glad for once to get the better of him in crossexamination I do  not  know for I have not made up my mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9553,9594,NA,You are going to dine said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9596,9687,NA,You dont mind admitting that I suppose No I returned I dont mind admitting that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9689,9710,NA,And are not engaged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9712,9763,NA,I dont mind admitting also that I am not engaged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9765,9814,NA,Then said Mr Jaggers come and dine with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9816,9879,NA,I was going to excuse myself when he added Wemmicks coming
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9881,10001,NA,So I changed my excuse into an acceptancethe few words I had uttered serving for the beginning of eitherand we went

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,421,NA,along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamplighters scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoons bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,423,575,NA,At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letterwriting handwashing candlesnuffing and safelocking that closed the business of the day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,577,934,NA,As I stood idle by Mr Jaggerss fire its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bopeep with me while the pair of coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr Jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty windingsheets as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,936,1050,NA,We went to Gerrard Street all three together in a hackneycoach And as soon as we got there dinner was served
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1052,1280,NA,Although I should not have thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmicks Walworth sentiments yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1282,1307,NA,But it was not to be done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1309,1474,NA,He turned his eyes on Mr Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks and this was the wrong one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1476,1539,NA,Did you send that note of Miss Havishams to Mr Pip Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1541,1586,NA,Mr Jaggers asked soon after we began dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1588,1680,NA,No sir returned Wemmick it was going by post when you brought Mr Pip into the office
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1682,1693,NA,Here it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1695,1741,NA,He handed it to his principal instead of to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1743,1889,NA,Its a note of two lines Pip said Mr Jaggers handing it on sent up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your address
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1891,1981,NA,She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1983,2078,NA,Youll go down Yes said I casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those terms
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2080,2265,NA,When do you think of going down I have an impending engagement said I glancing at Wemmick who was putting fish into the postoffice that renders me rather uncertain of my time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2267,2284,NA,At once I think
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2286,2402,NA,If Mr Pip has the intention of going at once said Wemmick to Mr Jaggers he neednt write an answer you know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2404,2515,NA,Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay I settled that I would go tomorrow and said so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2517,2626,NA,Wemmick drank a glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr Jaggers but not at me So Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2628,2691,NA,Our friend the Spider said Mr Jaggers has played his cards
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2693,2713,NA,He has won the pool
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2715,2753,NA,It was as much as I could do to assent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2755,2759,NA,Hah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2761,2835,NA,He is a promising fellowin his waybut he may not have it all his own way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2837,2913,NA,The stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to be found out first
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2915,3109,NA,If he should turn to and beat her Surely I interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that Mr Jaggers I didnt say so Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3111,3130,NA,I am putting a case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3132,3275,NA,If he should turn to and beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be a question of intellect he certainly will not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3277,3426,NA,It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances because its a tossup between two results
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3428,3540,NA,May I ask what they are A fellow like our friend the Spider answered Mr Jaggers either beats or cringes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3542,3622,NA,He may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but he either beats or cringes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3624,3650,NA,Ask Wemmick  his  opinion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3652,3728,NA,Either beats or cringes said Wemmick not at all addressing himself to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3730,3957,NA,So heres to Mrs Bentley Drummle said Mr Jaggers taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumbwaiter and filling for each of us and for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the ladys satisfaction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3959,4028,NA,To the satisfaction of the lady  and  the gentleman it never will be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4030,4087,NA,Now Molly Molly Molly Molly how slow you are today
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4089,4162,NA,She was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4164,4259,NA,As she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two nervously muttering some excuse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4261,4333,NA,And a certain action of her fingers as she spoke arrested my attention
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4335,4372,NA,Whats the matter said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4374,4382,NA,Nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4384,4457,NA,Only the subject we were speaking of said I was rather painful to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4459,4516,NA,The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4518,4671,NA,She stood looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4673,4697,NA,Her look was very intent
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4699,4786,NA,Surely I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4788,4836,NA,He dismissed her and she glided out of the room
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4838,4902,NA,But she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4904,5147,NA,I looked at those hands I looked at those eyes I looked at that flowing hair and I compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that I knew of and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5149,5353,NA,I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walkednot alonein the ruined garden and through the deserted brewery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5355,5646,NA,I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning when I had passed in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden glare of light in a dark street
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5648,5920,NA,I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link wanting before had been riveted for me now when I had passed by a chance swift from Estellas name to the fingers with their knitting action and the attentive eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5922,5988,NA,And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estellas mother
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5990,6110,NA,Mr Jaggers had seen me with Estella and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6112,6242,NA,He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the wine again and went on with his dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6244,6370,NA,Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the room was very short and Mr Jaggers was sharp with her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6372,6566,NA,But her hands were Estellas hands and her eyes were Estellas eyes and if she had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6568,6821,NA,It was a dull evening for Wemmick drew his wine when it came round quite as a matter of businessjust as he might have drawn his salary when that came roundand with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of perpetual readiness for crossexamination
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6823,6948,NA,As to the quantity of wine his postoffice was as indifferent and ready as any other postoffice for its quantity of letters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6950,7057,NA,From my point of view he was the wrong twin all the time and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7059,7101,NA,We took our leave early and left together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7103,7437,NA,Even when we were groping among Mr Jaggerss stock of boots for our hats I felt that the right twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7439,7473,NA,Well said Wemmick thats over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7475,7628,NA,Hes a wonderful man without his living likeness but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with himand I dine more comfortably unscrewed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7630,7696,NA,I felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7698,7752,NA,Wouldnt say it to anybody but yourself he answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7754,7815,NA,I know that what is said between you and me goes no further
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7817,7903,NA,I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havishams adopted daughter Mrs Bentley Drummle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7905,7915,NA,He said no
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7917,7989,NA,To avoid being too abrupt I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7991,8167,NA,He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8169,8296,NA,Wemmick said I do you remember telling me before I first went to Mr Jaggerss private house to notice that housekeeper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8298,8317,NA,Did I he replied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8319,8340,NA,Ah I dare say I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8342,8391,NA,Deuce take me he added suddenly I know I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8393,8429,NA,I find I am not quite unscrewed yet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8431,8508,NA,A wild beast tamed you called her And what do  you  call her The same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8510,8568,NA,How did Mr Jaggers tame her Wemmick Thats his secret
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8570,8609,NA,She has been with him many a long year
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8611,8646,NA,I wish you would tell me her story
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8648,8704,NA,I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8706,8768,NA,You know that what is said between you and me goes no further
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8770,8851,NA,Well Wemmick replied I dont know her storythat is I dont know all of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8853,8885,NA,But what I do know Ill tell you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8887,8944,NA,We are in our private and personal capacities of course
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8946,8957,NA,Of course
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8959,9056,NA,A score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for murder and was acquitted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9058,9136,NA,She was a very handsome young woman and I believe had some gypsy blood in her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9138,9199,NA,Anyhow it was hot enough when it was up as you may suppose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9201,9224,NA,But she was acquitted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9226,9229,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9231,9346,NA,Jaggers was for her pursued Wemmick with a look full of meaning and worked the case in a way quite astonishing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9348,9511,NA,It was a desperate case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to have made him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9513,9742,NA,He worked it himself at the policeoffice day after day for many days contending against even a committal and at the trial where he couldnt work it himself sat under counsel andevery one knewput in all the salt and pepper
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9744,9849,NA,The murdered person was a womana woman a good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9851,9876,NA,It was a case of jealousy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9878,10001,NA,They both led tramping lives and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young over the broomstick as we

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,70,NA,say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,72,191,NA,The murdered womanmore a match for the man certainly in point of yearswas found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,193,243,NA,There had been a violent struggle perhaps a fight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,245,337,NA,She was bruised and scratched and torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,339,516,NA,Now there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr Jaggers principally rested his case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,518,664,NA,You may be sure said Wemmick touching me on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then though he sometimes does now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,666,743,NA,I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner party
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,745,1068,NA,Well sir Wemmick went on it happenedhappened dont you seethat this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1070,1220,NA,She had only a bruise or two about hernothing for a trampbut the backs of her hands were lacerated and the question was Was it with fingernails
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1222,1679,NA,Now Mr Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1681,1950,NA,But the boldest point he made was this it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder frantically destroyed her child by this mansome three years oldto revenge herself upon him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1952,2085,NA,Mr Jaggers worked that in this way We say these are not marks of fingernails but marks of brambles and we show you the brambles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2087,2185,NA,You say they are marks of fingernails and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2187,2238,NA,You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2240,2357,NA,For anything we know she may have destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2359,2368,NA,What then
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2370,2435,NA,You are not trying her for the murder of her child why dont you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2437,2655,NA,As to this case if you  will  have scratches we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them To sum up sir said Wemmick Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2657,2762,NA,Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury and they gave in Has she been in his service ever since
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2764,2883,NA,Yes but not only that said Wemmick she went into his service immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2885,2996,NA,She has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed from the beginning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2998,3064,NA,Do you remember the sex of the child Said to have been a girl
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3066,3111,NA,You have nothing more to say to me tonight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3113,3121,NA,Nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3123,3157,NA,I got your letter and destroyed it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3159,3167,NA,Nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3169,3288,NA,We exchanged a cordial goodnight and I went home with new matter for my thoughts though with no relief from the old
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3290,3302,NA,Chapter XLIX
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3304,3542,NA,Putting Miss Havishams note in my pocket that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me I went down again by the coach next day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3544,3743,NA,But I alighted at the Halfway House and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it in the same manner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3745,3847,NA,The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the High Street
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3849,4075,NA,The nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4077,4491,NA,The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as I hurried on avoiding observation than they had ever had before so the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that Estella was gone out of it for ever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4493,4636,NA,An elderly woman whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the gate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4638,4751,NA,The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4753,4837,NA,Miss Havisham was not in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4839,4999,NA,Looking in at the door after knocking in vain I saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the ashy fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5001,5128,NA,Doing as I had often done I went in and stood touching the old chimneypiece where she could see me when she raised her eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5130,5286,NA,There was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge her with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5288,5451,NA,As I stood compassionating her and thinking how in the progress of time I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house her eyes rested on me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5453,5502,NA,She stared and said in a low voice Is it real
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5504,5517,NA,It is I Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5519,5584,NA,Mr Jaggers gave me your note yesterday and I have lost no time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5586,5596,NA,Thank you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5598,5608,NA,Thank you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5610,5748,NA,As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down I remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5750,5878,NA,I want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here and to show you that I am not all stone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5880,5961,NA,But perhaps you can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5963,6162,NA,When I said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again before I understood the action or knew how to receive it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6164,6259,NA,You said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do something useful and good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6261,6307,NA,Something that you would like done is it not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6309,6353,NA,Something that I would like done very much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6355,6367,NA,What is it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6369,6433,NA,I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6435,6566,NA,I had not got far into it when I judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me rather than of what I said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6568,6690,NA,It seemed to be so for when I stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6692,6884,NA,Do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me No no I answered how can you think so Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6886,6949,NA,I stopped because I thought you were not following what I said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6951,7012,NA,Perhaps I was not she answered putting a hand to her head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7014,7061,NA,Begin again and let me look at something else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7063,7067,NA,Stay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7069,7081,NA,Now tell me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7083,7247,NA,She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7249,7388,NA,I went on with my explanation and told her how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how in this I was disappointed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7390,7537,NA,That part of the subject I reminded her involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they were the weighty secrets of another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7539,7659,NA,So said she assenting with her head but not looking at me And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7661,7722,NA,I was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7724,7745,NA,Nine hundred pounds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7747,7863,NA,If I give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as you have kept your own Quite as faithfully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7865,7950,NA,And your mind will be more at rest Much more at rest Are you very unhappy now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7952,8041,NA,She asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted tone of sympathy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8043,8098,NA,I could not reply at the moment for my voice failed me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8100,8185,NA,She put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid her forehead on it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8187,8280,NA,I am far from happy Miss Havisham but I have other causes of disquiet than any you know of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8282,8320,NA,They are the secrets I have mentioned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8322,8393,NA,After a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8395,8467,NA,It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8469,8544,NA,Is it true Too true Can I only serve you Pip by serving your friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8546,8613,NA,Regarding that as done is there nothing I can do for you yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8615,8623,NA,Nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8625,8653,NA,I thank you for the question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8655,8705,NA,I thank you even more for the tone of the question
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8707,8728,NA,But there is nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8730,8823,NA,She presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8825,9020,NA,There were none there and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9022,9080,NA,You are still on friendly terms with Mr Jaggers Quite
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9082,9109,NA,I dined with him yesterday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9111,9222,NA,This is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9224,9417,NA,I keep no money here but if you would rather Mr Jaggers knew nothing of the matter I will send it to you Thank you Miss Havisham I have not the least objection to receiving it from him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9419,9578,NA,She read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9580,9736,NA,I took the tablets from her hand and it trembled again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached and put it in mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9738,9807,NA,All this she did without looking at me My name is on the first leaf
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9809,9924,NA,If you can ever write under my name I forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9926,9969,NA,O Miss Havisham said I I can do it now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9971,10001,NA,There have been sore mistakes 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,477,487,person,Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,3317,3324,person,Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,4758,4765,person,Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,123,NA,and my life has been a blind and thankless one and I want forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,125,455,NA,She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it and to my amazement I may even add to my terror dropped on her knees at my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have been raised to heaven from her mothers side
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,457,562,NA,To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,564,736,NA,I entreated her to rise and got my arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,738,863,NA,I had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the relief might do her good I bent over her without speaking
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,865,919,NA,She was not kneeling now but was down upon the ground
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,921,949,NA,O she cried despairingly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,951,968,NA,What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,970,1064,NA,What have I done If you mean Miss Havisham what have you done to injure me let me answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1066,1077,NA,Very little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1079,1126,NA,I should have loved her under any circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1128,1150,NA,Is she married Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1152,1237,NA,It was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1239,1256,NA,What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1258,1275,NA,What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1277,1370,NA,She wrung her hands and crushed her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1372,1390,NA,What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1392,1439,NA,I knew not how to answer or how to comfort her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1441,1632,NA,That she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found vengeance in I knew full well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1634,1962,NA,But that in shutting out the light of day she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker I knew equally well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1964,2321,NA,And could I look upon her without compassion seeing her punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2323,2471,NA,Until you spoke to her the other day and until I saw in you a lookingglass that showed me what I once felt myself I did not know what I had done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2473,2489,NA,What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2491,2508,NA,What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2510,2567,NA,And so again twenty fifty times over What had she done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2569,2671,NA,Miss Havisham I said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2673,2899,NA,But Estella is a different case and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2901,2921,NA,Yes yes I know it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2923,2940,NA,But Pipmy dear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2942,3009,NA,There was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3011,3019,NA,My dear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3021,3105,NA,Believe this when she first came to me I meant to save her from misery like my own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3107,3133,NA,At first I meant no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3135,3449,NA,Well well said I I hope so But as she grew and promised to be very beautiful I gradually did worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and point my lessons I stole her heart away and put ice in its place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3451,3550,NA,Better I could not help saying to have left her a natural heart even to be bruised or broken
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3552,3659,NA,With that Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then burst out again What had she done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3661,3939,NA,If you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me Miss Havisham I answered as delicately as I could I believe I may say that I do know your story and have known it ever since I first left this neighbourhood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3941,4031,NA,It has inspired me with great commiseration and I hope I understand it and its influences
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4033,4129,NA,Does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4131,4186,NA,Not as she is but as she was when she first came here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4188,4281,NA,She was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and her head leaning on them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4283,4343,NA,She looked full at me when I said this and replied Go on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4345,4370,NA,Whose child was Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4372,4390,NA,She shook her head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4392,4408,NA,You dont know
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4410,4434,NA,She shook her head again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4436,4488,NA,But Mr Jaggers brought her here or sent her here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4490,4508,NA,Brought her here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4510,4548,NA,Will you tell me how that came about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4550,4794,NA,She answered in a low whisper and with caution I had been shut up in these rooms a long time I dont know how long you know what time the clocks keep here when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear and love and save from my fate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4796,4936,NA,I had first seen him when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the newspapers before I and the world parted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4938,5002,NA,He told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5004,5067,NA,One night he brought her here asleep and I called her Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5069,5110,NA,Might I ask her age then Two or three
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5112,5189,NA,She herself knows nothing but that she was left an orphan and I adopted her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5191,5306,NA,So convinced I was of that womans being her mother that I wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5308,5379,NA,But to any mind I thought the connection here was clear and straight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5381,5437,NA,What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5439,5577,NA,I had succeeded on behalf of Herbert Miss Havisham had told me all she knew of Estella I had said and done what I could to ease her mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5579,5631,NA,No matter with what other words we parted we parted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5633,5700,NA,Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5702,5848,NA,I called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered that I would not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5850,5975,NA,For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5977,6225,NA,By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago and on which the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end I made my way to the ruined garden
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6227,6360,NA,I went all round it round by the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle round by the paths where Estella and I had walked
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6362,6395,NA,So cold so lonely so dreary all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6397,6517,NA,Taking the brewery on my way back I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it and walked through
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6519,6744,NA,I was going out at the opposite doornot easy to open now for the damp wood had started and swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of funguswhen I turned my head to look back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6746,6892,NA,A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6894,7054,NA,So strong was the impression that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancythough to be sure I was there in an instant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7056,7310,NA,The mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7312,7545,NA,Passing on into the front courtyard I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7547,7583,NA,I took the latter course and went up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7585,7730,NA,I looked into the room where I had left her and I saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7732,7834,NA,In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away I saw a great flaming light spring up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7836,7999,NA,In the same moment I saw her running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8001,8071,NA,I had a doublecaped greatcoat on and over my arm another thick coat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8073,8583,NA,That I got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over her that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer I covered her the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herselfthat this occurred I knew through the result but not through anything I felt or thought or knew I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8585,8781,NA,I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded bridal dress
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8783,8935,NA,Then I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8937,9267,NA,I still held her forcibly down with all my strength like a prisoner who might escape and I doubt if I even knew who she was or why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames were out until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9269,9340,NA,She was insensible and I was afraid to have her moved or even touched
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9342,9511,NA,Assistance was sent for and I held her until it came as if I unreasonably fancied I think I did that if I let her go the fire would break out again and consume her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9513,9688,NA,When I got up on the surgeons coming to her with other aid I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt for I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9690,9854,NA,On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9856,10001,NA,By the surgeons directions her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to be well suited to the dressing of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,2575,2582,person,Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,3782,3789,person,Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,5468,5474,person,Herbert

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,entity,5468,5474,location,Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,15,NA,f her injuries
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,17,163,NA,When I saw her again an hour afterwards she lay indeed where I had seen her strike her stick and had heard her say that she would lie one day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,165,488,NA,Though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had covered her to the throat with white cottonwool and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,490,635,NA,I found on questioning the servants that Estella was in Paris and I got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,637,791,NA,Miss Havishams family I took upon myself intending to communicate with Mr Matthew Pocket only and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,793,860,NA,This I did next day through Herbert as soon as I returned to town
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,862,983,NA,There was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had happened though with a certain terrible vivacity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,985,1145,NA,Towards midnight she began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice What have I done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1147,1221,NA,And then When she first came I meant to save her from misery like mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1223,1291,NA,And then Take the pencil and write under my name I forgive her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1293,1493,NA,She never changed the order of these three sentences but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1495,1801,NA,As I could do no service there and as I had nearer home that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind I decided in the course of the night that I would return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being taken up clear of the town
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1803,2103,NA,At about six oclock of the morning therefore I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as they said not stopping for being touched Take the pencil and write under my name I forgive her Chapter L My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in the morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2105,2297,NA,My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less severely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames had set in that direction and I felt thankful it was no worse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2299,2369,NA,My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2371,2575,NA,It was bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm those I carried in a sling and I could only wear my coat like a cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2577,2637,NA,My hair had been caught by the fire but not my head or face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2639,2776,NA,When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father he came back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2778,2990,NA,He was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them on again with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2992,3194,NA,At first as I lay quiet on the sofa I found it painfully difficult I might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3196,3330,NA,If I dozed for a minute I was awakened by Miss Havishams cries and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3332,3490,NA,This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered and Herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention engaged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3492,3550,NA,Neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3552,3738,NA,That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our agreeingwithout agreementto make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours not of so many weeks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3740,3832,NA,My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course whether all was well down the river
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3834,3970,NA,As he replied in the affirmative with perfect confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3972,4102,NA,But then as Herbert changed the bandages more by the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it spontaneously
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4104,4158,NA,I sat with Provis last night Handel two good hours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4160,4212,NA,Where was Clara Dear little thing said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4214,4268,NA,She was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4270,4339,NA,He was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4341,4380,NA,I doubt if he can hold out long though
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4382,4475,NA,What with rum and pepperand pepper and rumI should think his pegging must be nearly over
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4477,4570,NA,And then you will be married Herbert How can I take care of the dear child otherwiseLay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4572,4723,NA,your arm out upon the back of the sofa my dear boy and Ill sit down here and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4725,4749,NA,I was speaking of Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4751,4784,NA,Do you know Handel he improves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4786,4847,NA,I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4849,4860,NA,So you did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4862,4874,NA,And so he is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4876,4942,NA,He was very communicative last night and told me more of his life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4944,5034,NA,You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble withDid
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5036,5047,NA,I hurt you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5049,5087,NA,I had started but not under his touch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5089,5119,NA,His words had given me a start
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5121,5191,NA,I had forgotten that Herbert but I remember it now you speak of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5193,5198,NA,Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5200,5262,NA,He went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5264,5280,NA,Shall I tell you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5282,5336,NA,Or would it worry you just now Tell me by all means
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5338,5349,NA,Every word
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5351,5488,NA,Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5490,5531,NA,Your head is cool he said touching it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5533,5593,NA,Quite said I Tell me what Provis said my dear Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5595,5746,NA,It seems said Herbert theres a bandage off most charmingly and now comes the cool onemakes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow dont it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5748,5913,NA,but it will be comfortable presentlyit seems that the woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman revengeful Handel to the last degree
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5915,5936,NA,To what last degree
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5938,6013,NA,MurderDoes it strike too cold on that sensitive place I dont feel it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6015,6033,NA,How did she murder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6035,6055,NA,Whom did she murder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6057,6262,NA,Why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name said Herbert but she was tried for it and Mr Jaggers defended her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6264,6359,NA,It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim and there had been a strugglein a barn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6361,6506,NA,Who began it or how fair it was or how unfair may be doubtful but how it ended is certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6508,6568,NA,Was the woman brought in guilty No she was acquittedMy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6570,6636,NA,poor Handel I hurt you It is impossible to be gentler Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6638,6641,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6643,6764,NA,What else This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6766,7057,NA,On the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you the young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment and swore that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he should never see it again then she vanishedTheres
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7059,7176,NA,the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right hand which is a far easier job
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7178,7318,NA,I can do it better by this light than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when I dont see the poor blistered patches too distinctlyYou
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7320,7371,NA,dont think your breathing is affected my dear boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7373,7401,NA,You seem to breathe quickly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7403,7425,NA,Perhaps I do Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7427,7455,NA,Did the woman keep her oath
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7457,7503,NA,There comes the darkest part of Proviss life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7505,7541,NA,She did That is he says she did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7543,7684,NA,Why of course my dear boy returned Herbert in a tone of surprise and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me He says it all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7686,7714,NA,I have no other information
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7716,7732,NA,No to be sure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7734,8040,NA,Now whether pursued Herbert he had used the childs mother ill or whether he had used the childs mother well Provis doesnt say but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and forbearance towards her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8042,8368,NA,Therefore fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel out of whom the jealousy arose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8370,8457,NA,After the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the childs mother
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8459,8515,NA,I want to ask A moment my dear boy and I have done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8517,8786,NA,That evil genius Compeyson the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8788,8861,NA,It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Proviss animosity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8863,8956,NA,I want to know said I and particularly Herbert whether he told you when this happened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8958,8971,NA,Particularly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8973,9019,NA,Let me remember then what he said as to that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9021,9119,NA,His expression was a round score o year ago and amost directly after I took up wi Compeyson
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9121,9216,NA,How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard I think in my seventh year
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9218,9221,NA,Ay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9223,9574,NA,It had happened some three or four years then he said and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have been about your age Herbert said I after a short silence in a hurried way can you see me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire By the firelight answered Herbert coming close again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9576,9775,NA,Look at me I do look at you my dear boy Touch me I do touch you my dear boy You are not afraid that I am in any fever or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9777,9843,NA,Nno my dear boy said Herbert after taking time to examine me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9845,9897,NA,You are rather excited but you are quite yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9899,9924,NA,I know I am quite myself

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,4,NA,LI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6,108,NA,What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Estellas parentage I cannot say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,110,246,NA,It will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,248,482,NA,But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter downthat I ought not to let it rest but that I ought to see Mr Jaggers and come at the bare truth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,484,712,NA,I really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Estellas sake or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,714,775,NA,Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,777,858,NA,Any way I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,860,1032,NA,Herberts representations that if I did I should probably be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitives safety would depend upon me alone restrained my impatience
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1034,1236,NA,On the understanding again and again reiterated that come what would I was to go to Mr Jaggers tomorrow I at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts looked after and to stay at home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1238,1408,NA,Early next morning we went out together and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield I left Herbert to go his way into the City and took my way to Little Britain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1410,1559,NA,There were periodical occasions when Mr Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things straight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1561,1702,NA,On these occasions Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr Jaggerss room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1704,1919,NA,Finding such clerk on Wemmicks post that morning I knew what was going on but I was not sorry to have Mr Jaggers and Wemmick together as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1921,2012,NA,My appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders favoured my object
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2014,2308,NA,Although I had sent Mr Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town yet I had to give him all the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence than it had been before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2310,2399,NA,While I described the disaster Mr Jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2401,2539,NA,Wemmick leaned back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2541,2714,NA,The two brutal casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at the present moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2716,2858,NA,My narrative finished and their questions exhausted I then produced Miss Havishams authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2860,3047,NA,Mr Jaggerss eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to Wemmick with instructions to draw the check for his signature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3049,3329,NA,While that was in course of being done I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote and Mr Jaggers poising and swaying himself on his wellpolished boots looked on at me I am sorry Pip said he as I put the check in my pocket when he had signed it that we do nothing for  you 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3331,3502,NA,Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me I returned whether she could do nothing for me and I told her No Everybody should know his own business said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3504,3563,NA,And I saw Wemmicks lips form the words portable property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3565,3687,NA,I should  not  have told her No if I had been you said Mr Jaggers but every man ought to know his own business best
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3689,3782,NA,Every mans business said Wemmick rather reproachfully towards me is portable property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3784,3942,NA,As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart I said turning on Mr Jaggers I did ask something of Miss Havisham however sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3944,4052,NA,I asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me all she possessed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4054,4150,NA,Did she said Mr Jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4152,4156,NA,Hah
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4158,4222,NA,I dont think I should have done so if I had been Miss Havisham
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4224,4270,NA,But  she  ought to know her own business best
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4272,4369,NA,I know more of the history of Miss Havishams adopted child than Miss Havisham herself does sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4371,4389,NA,I know her mother
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4391,4500,NA,Mr Jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated Mother I have seen her mother within these three days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4502,4525,NA,Yes said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4527,4548,NA,And so have you sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4550,4592,NA,And you have seen her still more recently
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4594,4617,NA,Yes said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4619,4711,NA,Perhaps I know more of Estellas history than even you do said I I know her father too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4713,4938,NA,A certain stop that Mr Jaggers came to in his mannerhe was too selfpossessed to change his manner but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stopassured me that he did not know who her father was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4940,5216,NA,This I had strongly suspected from Proviss account as Herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr Jaggerss client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5218,5330,NA,But I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr Jaggerss part before though I was quite sure of it now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5332,5335,NA,So
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5337,5393,NA,You know the young ladys father Pip said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5395,5458,NA,Yes I replied and his name is Provisfrom New South Wales
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5460,5508,NA,Even Mr Jaggers started when I said those words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5510,5709,NA,It was the slightest start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pockethandkerchief
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5711,5919,NA,How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say for I was afraid to look at him just then lest Mr Jaggerss sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5921,6068,NA,And on what evidence Pip asked Mr Jaggers very coolly as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does Provis make this claim
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6070,6190,NA,He does not make it said I and has never made it and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6192,6241,NA,For once the powerful pockethandkerchief failed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6243,6457,NA,My reply was so unexpected that Mr Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked with stern attention at me though with an immovable face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6459,6619,NA,Then I told him all I knew and how I knew it with the one reservation that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6621,6657,NA,I was very careful indeed as to that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6659,6792,NA,Nor did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell and had been for some time silently meeting Mr Jaggerss look
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6794,6928,NA,When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmicks direction I found that he had unposted his pen and was intent upon the table before him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6930,7006,NA,Hah said Mr Jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7008,7069,NA,What item was it you were at Wemmick when Mr Pip came in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7071,7218,NA,But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way and I made a passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7220,7400,NA,I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery I had made and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7402,7534,NA,I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him in return for the confidence I had just now imparted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7536,7646,NA,I said that I did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but I wanted assurance of the truth from him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7648,7979,NA,And if he asked me why I wanted it and why I thought I had any right to it I would tell him little as he cared for such poor dreams that I had loved Estella dearly and long and that although I had lost her and must live a bereaved life whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7981,8172,NA,And seeing that Mr Jaggers stood quite still and silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal I turned to Wemmick and said Wemmick I know you to be a man with a gentle heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8174,8312,NA,I have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8314,8462,NA,And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr Jaggers and to represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more open with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8464,8575,NA,I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8577,8768,NA,At first a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment but it melted as I saw Mr Jaggers relax into something like a smile and Wemmick become bolder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8770,8805,NA,Whats all this said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8807,8897,NA,You with an old father and you with pleasant and playful ways Well returned Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8899,8947,NA,If I dont bring em here what does it matter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8949,9081,NA,Pip said Mr Jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9083,9145,NA,Not a bit of it returned Wemmick growing bolder and bolder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9147,9171,NA,I think youre another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9173,9284,NA,Again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9286,9332,NA, You  with a pleasant home said Mr Jaggers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9334,9407,NA,Since it dont interfere with business returned Wemmick let it be so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9409,9585,NA,Now I look at you sir I shouldnt wonder if  you  might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days when youre tired of all this work
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9587,9675,NA,Mr Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and actually drew a sigh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9677,9812,NA,Pip said he we wont talk about poor dreams you know more about such things than I having much fresher experience of that kind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9814,9845,NA,But now about this other matter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9847,9869,NA,Ill put a case to you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9871,9875,NA,Mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9877,9893,NA,I admit nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9895,9994,NA,He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,40,NA,Pip said Mr Jaggers put this case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,42,330,NA,Put the case that a woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,332,624,NA,Put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up I follow you sir Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,626,909,NA,Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported neglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing up to be hanged
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,911,1163,NA,Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his netto be prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1165,1444,NA,I follow you sir Put the case Pip that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this power I know what you did and how you did it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1446,1514,NA,You came so and so you did such and such things to divert suspicion
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1516,1572,NA,I have tracked you through it all and I tell it you all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1574,1682,NA,Part with the child unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1684,1752,NA,Give the child into my hands and I will do my best to bring you off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1754,1840,NA,If you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost your child is still saved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1842,1906,NA,Put the case that this was done and that the woman was cleared
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1908,1936,NA,I understand you perfectly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1938,1969,NA,But that I make no admissions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1971,2000,NA,That you make no admissions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2002,2039,NA,And Wemmick repeated No admissions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2041,2256,NA,Put the case Pip that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the womans intellects and that when she was set at liberty she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2258,2438,NA,Put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out by asserting his power over her in the old way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2440,2486,NA,Do you comprehend the imaginary case Quite
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2488,2551,NA,Put the case that the child grew up and was married for money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2553,2585,NA,That the mother was still living
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2587,2619,NA,That the father was still living
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2621,2752,NA,That the mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many miles furlongs yards if you like of one another
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2754,2824,NA,That the secret was still a secret except that you had got wind of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2826,2872,NA,Put that last case to yourself very carefully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2874,2880,NA,I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2882,2935,NA,I ask Wemmick to put it to  him self very carefully
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2937,2961,NA,And Wemmick said I do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2963,3006,NA,For whose sake would you reveal the secret
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3008,3024,NA,For the fathers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3026,3080,NA,I think he would not be much the better for the mother
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3082,3098,NA,For the mothers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3100,3168,NA,I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3170,3188,NA,For the daughters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3190,3384,NA,I think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to disgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3386,3805,NA,But add the case that you had loved her Pip and had made her the subject of those poor dreams which have at one time or another been in the heads of more men than you think likely then I tell you that you had betterand would much sooner when you had thought well of itchop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there to cut  that  off too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3807,3853,NA,I looked at Wemmick whose face was very grave
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3855,3902,NA,He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3904,3918,NA,I did the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3920,3944,NA,Mr Jaggers did the same
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3946,4359,NA,Now Wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what item was it you were at when Mr Pip came in Standing by for a little while they were at work I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times with this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4361,4575,NA,For this reason I suppose they were now inflexible with one another Mr Jaggers being highly dictatorial and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4577,4669,NA,I had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they got on very well indeed together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4671,4893,NA,But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4895,5135,NA,This individual who either in his own person or in that of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in that place meant Newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5137,5326,NA,As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick Mr Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings Mikes eye happened to twinkle with a tear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5328,5395,NA,What are you about demanded Wemmick with the utmost indignation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5397,5472,NA,What do you come snivelling here for I didnt go to do it Mr Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5474,5497,NA,You did said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5499,5512,NA,How dare you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5514,5611,NA,Youre not in a fit state to come here if you cant come here without spluttering like a bad pen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5613,5636,NA,What do you mean by it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5638,5696,NA,A man cant help his feelings Mr Wemmick pleaded Mike
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5698,5742,NA,His what demanded Wemmick quite savagely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5744,5846,NA,Say that again Now look here my man said Mr Jaggers advancing a step and pointing to the door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5848,5871,NA,Get out of this office
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5873,5899,NA,Ill have no feelings here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5901,5957,NA,Get out It serves you right said Wemmick Get out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5959,6181,NA,So the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew and Mr Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have reestablished their good understanding and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6183,6194,NA,Chapter LII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6196,6460,NA,From Little Britain I went with my check in my pocket to Miss Skiffinss brother the accountant and Miss Skiffinss brother the accountant going straight to Clarrikers and bringing Clarriker to me I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6462,6593,NA,It was the only good thing I had done and the only completed thing I had done since I was first apprised of my great expectations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6595,7021,NA,Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a small branchhouse in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more settled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7023,7146,NA,And now indeed I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7148,7526,NA,But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights and of me going out to join them with a caravan of camels I believe and of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7528,7753,NA,Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans I felt that Herberts way was clearing fast and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his daughter would soon be happily provided for
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7755,7793,NA,We had now got into the month of March
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7795,7930,NA,My left arm though it presented no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7932,8003,NA,My right arm was tolerably restored disfigured but fairly serviceable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8005,8120,NA,On a Monday morning when Herbert and I were at breakfast I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8122,8131,NA,Walworth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8133,8158,NA,Burn this as soon as read
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8160,8258,NA,Early in the week or say Wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8260,8269,NA,Now burn
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8271,8398,NA,When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the firebut not before we had both got it by heartwe considered what to do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8400,8472,NA,For of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8474,8595,NA,I have thought it over again and again said Herbert and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8597,8609,NA,Take Startop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8611,8686,NA,A good fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honourable
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8688,8723,NA,I had thought of him more than once
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8725,8809,NA,But how much would you tell him Herbert It is necessary to tell him very little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8811,8972,NA,Let him suppose it a mere freak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8974,8990,NA,You go with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8992,9002,NA,No doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9004,9011,NA,Where
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9013,9220,NA,It had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations I had given the point almost indifferent what port we made forHamburg Rotterdam Antwerpthe place signified little so that he was out of England
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9222,9292,NA,Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9294,9475,NA,I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat certainly well beyond Gravesend which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9477,9673,NA,As foreign steamers would leave London at about the time of highwater our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebbtide and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9675,9810,NA,The time when one would be due where we lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we made inquiries beforehand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9812,9914,NA,Herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9916,10001,NA,We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we direct

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,40,NA,ted our thoughts chiefly to that vessel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,42,195,NA,But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave London with the same tide and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,197,323,NA,We then separated for a few hours I to get at once such passports as were necessary Herbert to see Startop at his lodgings
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,325,431,NA,We both did what we had to do without any hindrance and when we met again at one oclock reported it done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,433,538,NA,I for my part was prepared with passports Herbert had seen Startop and he was more than ready to join
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,540,707,NA,Those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and I would steer our charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our object we should make way enough
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,709,1165,NA,We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening that he should not go there at all tomorrow evening Tuesday that he should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on Wednesday when he saw us approach and not sooner that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night and that he should be communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1167,1227,NA,These precautions well understood by both of us I went home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1229,1372,NA,On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key I found a letter in the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not illwritten
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1374,1628,NA,It had been delivered by hand of course since I left home and its contents were these If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow night at nine and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln you had better come
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1630,1743,NA,If you want information regarding  your uncle Provis  you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1746,1766,NA,You must come alone 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1768,1788,NA,Bring this with you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1790,1866,NA,I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1868,1900,NA,What to do now I could not tell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1902,2032,NA,And the worst was that I must decide quickly or I should miss the afternoon coach which would take me down in time for tonight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2034,2131,NA,Tomorrow night I could not think of going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2133,2245,NA,And again for anything I knew the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2247,2324,NA,If I had had ample time for consideration I believe I should still have gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2326,2448,NA,Having hardly any time for considerationmy watch showing me that the coach started within half an hourI resolved to go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2450,2524,NA,I should certainly not have gone but for the reference to my Uncle Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2526,2611,NA,That coming on Wemmicks letter and the mornings busy preparation turned the scale
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2613,2844,NA,It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter in a violent hurry that I had to read this mysterious epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2846,3101,NA,Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way I left a note in pencil for Herbert telling him that as I should be so soon going away I knew not for how long I had decided to hurry down and back to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3103,3220,NA,I had then barely time to get my greatcoat lock up the chambers and make for the coachoffice by the short byways
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3222,3375,NA,If I had taken a hackneychariot and gone by the streets I should have missed my aim going as I did I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3377,3464,NA,I was the only inside passenger jolting away kneedeep in straw when I came to myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3466,3592,NA,For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3594,3734,NA,The morning hurry and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3736,4120,NA,And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4122,4180,NA,Still the reference to Provis by name mastered everything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4182,4349,NA,I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing itif that be reasoningin case any harm should befall him through my not going how could I ever forgive myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4351,4513,NA,It was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside in my disabled state
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4515,4616,NA,Avoiding the Blue Boar I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4618,4754,NA,While it was preparing I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham she was still very ill though considered something better
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4756,4878,NA,My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and I dined in a little octagonal commonroom like a font
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4880,4971,NA,As I was not able to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4973,5171,NA,This bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain me with my own storyof course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5173,5243,NA,Do you know the young man said I Know him repeated the landlord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5245,5329,NA,Ever since he wasno height at all Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5331,5462,NA,Ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5464,5524,NA,What man is that Him that I speak of said the landlord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5526,5529,NA,Mr
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5531,5543,NA,Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5545,5653,NA,Is he ungrateful to no one else No doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he cant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5655,5662,NA,And why
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5664,5708,NA,Because Pumblechook done everything for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5710,5767,NA,Does Pumblechook say so Say so replied the landlord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5769,5919,NA,He hant no call to say so But does he say so It would turn a mans blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it sir said the landlord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5921,5974,NA,I thought Yet Joe dear Joe  you  never tell of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5976,6027,NA,Longsuffering and loving Joe  you  never complain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6029,6176,NA,Nor you sweettempered Biddy Your appetites been touched like by your accident said the landlord glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6178,6273,NA,Try a tenderer bit No thank you I replied turning from the table to brood over the fire
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6275,6293,NA,I can eat no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6295,6315,NA,Please take it away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6317,6426,NA,I had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to Joe as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6428,6487,NA,The falser he the truer Joe the meaner he the nobler Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6489,6581,NA,My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire for an hour or more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6583,6724,NA,The striking of the clock aroused me but not from my dejection or remorse and I got up and had my coat fastened round my neck and went out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6726,6917,NA,I had previously sought in my pockets for the letter that I might refer to it again but I could not find it and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6919,7048,NA,I knew very well however that the appointed place was the little sluicehouse by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7050,7114,NA,Towards the marshes I now went straight having no time to spare
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7116,7143,NA,Illustration Chapter LIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7145,7253,NA,It was a dark night though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands and passed out upon the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7255,7357,NA,Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7359,7455,NA,In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the piled mountains of cloud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7457,7518,NA,There was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7520,7649,NA,A stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were so oppressive that I hesitated half inclined to go back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7651,7768,NA,But I knew them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had no excuse for returning being there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7770,7836,NA,So having come there against my inclination I went on against it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7838,7948,NA,The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay nor that in which we had pursued the convicts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7950,8104,NA,My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on and though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand I saw them over my shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8106,8336,NA,I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery but they were miles apart so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8338,8523,NA,At first I had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the bankedup pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8525,8592,NA,But after a little while I seemed to have the whole flats to myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8594,8649,NA,It was another halfhour before I drew near to the kiln
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8651,8768,NA,The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and left and no workmen were visible
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8770,8802,NA,Hard by was a small stonequarry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8804,8916,NA,It lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8918,9048,NA,Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavationfor the rude path lay through itI saw a light in the old sluicehouse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9050,9107,NA,I quickened my pace and knocked at the door with my hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9109,9442,NA,Waiting for some reply I looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and how the houseof wood with a tiled roofwould not be proof against the weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime and how the choking vapour of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9444,9490,NA,Still there was no answer and I knocked again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9492,9530,NA,No answer still and I tried the latch
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9532,9575,NA,It rose under my hand and the door yielded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9577,9669,NA,Looking in I saw a lighted candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9671,9731,NA,As there was a loft above I called Is there any one here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9733,9754,NA,but no voice answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9756,9856,NA,Then I looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine called again Is there any one here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9858,9932,NA,There being still no answer I went out at the door irresolute what to do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9934,9963,NA,It was beginning to rain fast

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,116,NA,already I turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter of the doorway looking out into the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,118,300,NA,While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the wick were long
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,302,535,NA,I turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next thing I comprehended was that I had been caught in a strong running noose thrown over my head from behind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,537,612,NA,Now said a suppressed voice with an oath Ive got you What is this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,614,633,NA,I cried struggling

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,666,769,NA,Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,771,1000,NA,Sometimes a strong mans hand sometimes a strong mans breast was set against my mouth to deaden my cries and with a hot breath always close to me I struggled ineffectually in the dark while I was fastened tight to the wall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1002,1312,NA,And now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and Ill make short work of you Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution I desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1314,1350,NA,But it was bound too tight for that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1352,1416,NA,I felt as if having been burnt before it were now being boiled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1418,1549,NA,The sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1551,1652,NA,After groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he wanted and began to strike a light
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1654,1861,NA,I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed match in hand but I could only see his lips and the blue point of the match even those but fitfully

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1944,2010,NA,The man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2012,2189,NA,As the sparks fell thick and bright about him I could see his hands and touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table but nothing more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2191,2311,NA,Presently I saw his blue lips again breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and showed me Orlick

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2376,2463,NA,Seeing him I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed and I kept my eyes upon him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2465,2573,NA,He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation and dropped the match and trod it out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2575,2709,NA,Then he put the candle away from him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2711,2856,NA,I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the walla fixture therethe means of ascent to the loft above

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3269,3469,NA,O you enemy you enemy His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished as he sat with his arms folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a malignity in it that made me tremble
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3471,3587,NA,As I watched him in silence he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a brassbound stock
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3589,3691,NA,Do you know this said he making as if he would take aim at me Do you know where you saw it afore

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5158,5245,NA,For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5247,5380,NA,More than that said he folding his arms on the table again I wont have a rag of you I wont have a bone of you left on earth

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6033,6154,NA,The death close before me was terrible but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6511,6669,NA,It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though few could know better than I the solitary nature of the spot and the hopelessness of aid
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6671,6771,NA,But as he sat gloating over me I was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6773,6892,NA,Above all things I resolved that I would not entreat him and that I would die making some last poor resistance to him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6894,7308,NA,Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as I did of Heaven melted at heart as I was by the thought that I had taken no farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my miserable errorsstill if I could have killed him even in dying I would have done it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7369,7477,NA,Around his neck was slung a tin bottle as I had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7479,7607,NA,He brought the bottle to his lips and took a fiery drink from it and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into his face

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8654,8747,NA,I distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8803,9075,NA,I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept towards me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do as he had done in my sisters casemake all haste to the town and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9077,9291,NA,My rapid mind pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapour creeping over it into which I should have dissolved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9293,9461,NA,It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented pictures to me and not mere words

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7793,7914,NA,Its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7916,8128,NA,His uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an hours consideration he set off for the coachoffice with Startop who volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8130,8299,NA,Finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he resolved to follow in a postchaise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8301,8465,NA,So he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but finding neither went on to Miss Havishams where they lost me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8467,8671,NA,Hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8673,8919,NA,Among the loungers under the Boars archway happened to be Trabbs Boytrue to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no businessand Trabbs boy had seen me passing from Miss Havishams in the direction of my diningplace
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8921,9064,NA,Thus Trabbs boy became their guide and with him they went out to the sluicehouse though by the town way to the marshes which I had avoided
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9066,9480,NA,Now as they went along Herbert reflected that I might after all have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Proviss safety and bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9482,9752,NA,As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so busy he even at last began to doubt whether I was there when suddenly I cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely followed by the other two
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9754,9924,NA,When I told Herbert what had passed within the house he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it was and getting out a warrant
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9926,10001,NA,But I had already considered that such a course by detaining us there or

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,53,158,NA,There was no gainsaying this difficulty and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,160,408,NA,For the present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabbs boy who I am convinced would have been much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,410,586,NA,Not that Trabbs boy was of a malignant nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodys expense
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,588,780,NA,When we parted I presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his views and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,782,983,NA,Wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to London that night three in the postchaise the rather as we should then be clear away before the nights adventure began to be talked of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,985,1152,NA,Herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through I was just able to bear its pain on the journey
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1154,1247,NA,It was daylight when we reached the Temple and I went at once to bed and lay in bed all day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1249,1389,NA,My terror as I lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for tomorrow was so besetting that I wonder it did not disable me of itself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1391,1545,NA,It would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon me that tomorrow was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1547,1661,NA,So anxiously looked forward to charged with such consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1663,1804,NA,No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day yet this again increased my restlessness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1806,1935,NA,I started at every footstep and every sound believing that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell me so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1937,2122,NA,I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact had occurred and I had a mysterious knowledge of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2124,2306,NA,As the days wore on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow morning altogether mastered me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2308,2402,NA,My burning arm throbbed and my burning head throbbed and I fancied I was beginning to wander
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2404,2510,NA,I counted up to high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2512,2700,NA,It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind I dozed for some moments or forgot then I would say to myself with a start Now it has come and I am turning delirious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2702,2797,NA,They kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and gave me cooling drinks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2799,2947,NA,Whenever I fell asleep I awoke with the notion I had had in the sluicehouse that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2949,3099,NA,About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert with the conviction that I had been asleep for fourandtwenty hours and that Wednesday was past
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3101,3189,NA,It was the last selfexhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that I slept soundly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3191,3248,NA,Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3250,3359,NA,The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3361,3520,NA,The river still dark and mysterious was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3522,3743,NA,As I looked along the clustered roofs with churchtowers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3745,3811,NA,From me too a veil seemed to be drawn and I felt strong and well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3813,3893,NA,Herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellowstudent lay asleep on the sofa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3895,4017,NA,I could not dress myself without help but I made up the fire which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4019,4179,NA,In good time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4181,4321,NA,When it turns at nine oclock said Herbert cheerfully look out for us and stand ready you over there at Mill Pond Bank Chapter LIV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4323,4458,NA,It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4460,4506,NA,We had our peacoats with us and I took a bag
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4508,4597,NA,Of all my worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4599,4769,NA,Where I might go what I might do or when I might return were questions utterly unknown to me nor did I vex my mind with them for it was wholly set on Proviss safety
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4771,4924,NA,I only wondered for the passing moment as I stopped at the door and looked back under what altered circumstances I should next see those rooms if ever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4926,5051,NA,We loitered down to the Temple stairs and stood loitering there as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5053,5134,NA,Of course I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5136,5335,NA,After a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs we went on board and cast off Herbert in the bow I steering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5337,5382,NA,It was then about highwaterhalfpast eight
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5384,5401,NA,Our plan was this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5403,5555,NA,The tide beginning to run down at nine and being with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned and row against it until dark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5557,5836,NA,We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend between Kent and Essex where the river is broad and solitary where the waterside inhabitants are very few and where lone publichouses are scattered here and there of which we could choose one for a restingplace
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5838,5873,NA,There we meant to lie by all night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5875,5986,NA,The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5988,6169,NA,We should know at what time to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have another chance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6171,6218,NA,We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6220,6395,NA,The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in which I had been a few hours before
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6397,6599,NA,The crisp air the sunlight the movement on the river and the moving river itselfthe road that ran with us seeming to sympathise with us animate us and encourage us onfreshened me with new hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6601,6770,NA,I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6772,6895,NA,At that time the steamtraffic on the Thames was far below its present extent and watermens boats were far more numerous
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6897,7060,NA,Of barges sailing colliers and coastingtraders there were perhaps as many as now but of steamships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part so many
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7062,7385,NA,Early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7387,7568,NA,Old London Bridge was soon passed and old Billingsgate Market with its oysterboats and Dutchmen and the White Tower and Traitors Gate and we were in among the tiers of shipping
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7570,8074,NA,Here were the Leith Aberdeen and Glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside here were colliers by the score and score with the coalwhippers plunging off stages on deck as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled over the side into barges here at her moorings was tomorrows steamer for Rotterdam of which we took good notice and here tomorrows for Hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8076,8184,NA,And now I sitting in the stern could see with a faster beating heart Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8186,8213,NA,Is he there said Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8215,8224,NA,Not yet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8226,8232,NA,Right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8234,8272,NA,He was not to come down till he saw us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8274,8297,NA,Can you see his signal
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8299,8344,NA,Not well from here but I think I see itNow

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8390,8483,NA,We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board and we were off again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8485,8604,NA,He had a boatcloak with him and a black canvas bag and he looked as like a riverpilot as my heart could have wished
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8606,8678,NA,Dear boy he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his seat

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,138,223,NA,He had his boatcloak on him and looked as I have said a natural part of the scene
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,225,345,NA,It was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,347,594,NA,He was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not disposed to be passive or resigned as I understood it but he had no notion of meeting danger half way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,596,680,NA,When it came upon him he confronted it but it must come before he troubled himself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,682,849,NA,If you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day betwixt four walls youd envy me

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,883,935,NA,I think I know the delights of freedom I answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,937,976,NA,Ah said he shaking his head gravely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,978,1012,NA,But you dont know it equal to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1014,1117,NA,You must have been under lock and key dear boy to know it equal to mebut I aint agoing to be low
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1119,1240,NA,It occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he should have endangered his freedom and even his life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1242,1393,NA,But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1395,1617,NA,I was not far out since he said after smoking a little You see dear boy when I was over yonder tother side the world I was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for all I was a growing rich

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2008,2175,NA,He dipped his hand in the water over the boats gunwale and said smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me Ay I spose I think so dear boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2177,2247,NA,Wed be puzzled to be more quiet and easygoing than we are at present
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2249,2508,NA,Butits a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water praps as makes me think itI was a thinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2510,2571,NA,Nor yet we cant no more hold their tide than I can hold this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2573,2653,NA,And its run through my fingers and gone you see holding up his dripping hand

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2756,2865,NA,It comes of flowing on so quiet and of that there rippling at the boats head making a sort of a Sunday tune
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2867,2908,NA,Maybe Im a growing a trifle old besides
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2910,3054,NA,He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3056,3299,NA,Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat and he was stepping out I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was and he said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3301,3347,NA,Do you dear boy and quietly sat down again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3349,3442,NA,The air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the sunshine was very cheering
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3444,3548,NA,The tide ran strong I took care to lose none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3550,3758,NA,By imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3760,4032,NA,As our charge was wrapped in his cloak I purposely passed within a boat or twos length of the floating Custom House and so out to catch the stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4034,4403,NA,And soon the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4405,4579,NA,Our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hours rest proved full as much as they wanted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4581,4682,NA,We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4684,4907,NA,It was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed stranded and still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4909,5512,NA,For now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed and the last green barge strawladen with a brown sail had followed and some ballastlighters shaped like a childs first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud and a little squat shoallighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud and an old landingstage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5514,5561,NA,We pushed off again and made what way we could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5563,5681,NA,It was much harder work now but Herbert and Startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5683,5765,NA,By that time the river had lifted us a little so that we could see above the bank
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5767,6053,NA,There was the red sun on the low level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black and there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6055,6262,NA,As the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full would not rise early we held a little council a short one for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6264,6343,NA,So they plied their oars once more and I looked out for anything like a house
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6345,6406,NA,Thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6408,6527,NA,It was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galleyfire smoking and flaring looked like a comfortable home
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6529,6726,NA,The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning and what light we had seemed to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6728,6813,NA,At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6815,6990,NA,As the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6992,7141,NA,Here and there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them nervously
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7143,7212,NA,Sometimes What was that ripple one of us would say in a low voice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7214,7249,NA,Or another Is that a boat yonder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7251,7405,NA,And afterwards we would fall into a dead silence and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7407,7552,NA,At length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7554,7657,NA,Leaving the rest in the boat I stepped ashore and found the light to be in a window of a publichouse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7659,7849,NA,It was a dirty place enough and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various liquors to drink
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7851,7931,NA,Also there were two doublebedded roomssuch as they were the landlord said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7933,8125,NA,No other company was in the house than the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the Jack of the little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been lowwater mark too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8127,8300,NA,With this assistant I went down to the boat again and we all came ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boathook and all else and hauled her up for the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8302,8449,NA,We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms Herbert and Startop were to occupy one I and our charge the other
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8451,8641,NA,We found the air as carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8643,8747,NA,But we considered ourselves well off notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8749,9123,NA,While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the Jackwho was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashoreasked me if we had seen a fouroared galley going up with the tide
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9125,9229,NA,When I told him No he said she must have gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9231,9325,NA,They must ha thought better ont for some reason or another said the Jack and gone down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9327,9413,NA,A fouroared galley did you say said I A four said the Jack and two sitters
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9415,9442,NA,Did they come ashore here
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9444,9498,NA,They put in with a stone twogallon jar for some beer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9500,9595,NA,Id ha been glad to pison the beer myself said the Jack or put some rattling physic in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9597,9633,NA,Why  I  know why said the Jack
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9635,9704,NA,He spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud had washed into his throat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9706,9857,NA,He thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye who seemed to rely greatly on his Jackhe thinks they was what they wasnt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9859,9903,NA, I  knows what I thinks observed the Jack
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9905,9955,NA, You  thinks Custom Us Jack said the landlord

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,227,NA,ack AM I In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,229,316,NA,He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,318,430,NA,Why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then Jack asked the landlord vacillating weakly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,432,457,NA,Done with their buttons
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,459,476,NA,returned the Jack
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,478,500,NA,Chucked em overboard

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,578,662,NA,Dont be cheeky Jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and pathetic way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,664,840,NA,A Custom Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons said the Jack repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they comes betwixt him and his own light
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,842,1022,NA,A four and two sitters dont go hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both with and against another without there being Custom Us at the bottom of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1024,1152,NA,Saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord having no one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1154,1206,NA,This dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1208,1344,NA,The dismal wind was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1346,1479,NA,A fouroared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1481,1637,NA,When I had induced Provis to go up to bed I went outside with my two companions Startop by this time knew the state of the case and held another council
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1639,1831,NA,Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamers time which would be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the morning was the question we discussed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1833,2013,NA,On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the steamers time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with the tide
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2015,2084,NA,Having settled to do this we returned into the house and went to bed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2086,2167,NA,I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a few hours
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2169,2300,NA,When I awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house the Ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2302,2374,NA,Rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep I looked out of the window
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2376,2534,NA,It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon I saw two men looking into her
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2536,2731,NA,They passed by under the window looking at nothing else and they did not go down to the landingplace which I could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2733,2809,NA,My first impulse was to call up Herbert and show him the two men going away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2811,2986,NA,But reflecting before I got into his room which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine that he and Startop had had a harder day than I and were fatigued I forbore
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2988,3058,NA,Going back to my window I could see the two men moving over the marsh
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3060,3180,NA,In that light however I soon lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and fell asleep again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3182,3198,NA,We were up early
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3200,3306,NA,As we walked to and fro all four together before breakfast I deemed it right to recount what I had seen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3308,3359,NA,Again our charge was the least anxious of the party
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3361,3474,NA,It was very likely that the men belonged to the Custom House he said quietly and that they had no thought of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3476,3549,NA,I tried to persuade myself that it was soas indeed it might easily be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3551,3746,NA,However I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about noon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3748,3867,NA,This being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he and I set forth without saying anything at the tavern
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3869,3954,NA,He smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3956,4050,NA,One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger not he and that he was reassuring me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4052,4072,NA,We spoke very little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4074,4237,NA,As we approached the point I begged him to remain in a sheltered place while I went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4239,4271,NA,He complied and I went on alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4273,4403,NA,There was no boat off the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4405,4494,NA,But to be sure the tide was high and there might have been some footprints under water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4496,4764,NA,When he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4766,4831,NA,We got aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4833,4926,NA,By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one oclock and we began to look out for her smoke
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4928,5044,NA,But it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5046,5178,NA,As they were coming on at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity of saying goodbye to Herbert and Startop
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5180,5389,NA,We had all shaken hands cordially and neither Herberts eyes nor mine were quite dry when I saw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us and row out into the same track
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5391,5546,NA,A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamers smoke by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible coming head on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5548,5706,NA,I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide that she might see us lying by for her and I adjured Provis to sit quite still wrapped in his cloak
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5708,5776,NA,He answered cheerily Trust to me dear boy and sat like a statue
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5778,5894,NA,Meantime the galley which was very skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen alongside
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5896,6035,NA,Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6037,6273,NA,Of the two sitters one held the rudderlines and looked at us attentivelyas did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up much as Provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6275,6311,NA,Not a word was spoken in either boat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6313,6453,NA,Startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first and gave me the word Hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6455,6538,NA,She was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6540,6614,NA,I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the galley hailed us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6616,6626,NA,I answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6628,6698,NA,You have a returned Transport there said the man who held the lines
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6700,6737,NA,Thats the man wrapped in the cloak
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6739,6782,NA,His name is Abel Magwitch otherwise Provis
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6784,6856,NA,I apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender and you to assist
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6858,6958,NA,At the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew he ran the galley abroad of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6960,7115,NA,They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to our gunwale before we knew what they were doing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7117,7313,NA,This caused great confusion on board the steamer and I heard them calling to us and heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7315,7564,NA,In the same moment I saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoners shoulder and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7566,7716,NA,Still in the same moment I saw the prisoner start up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7718,7820,NA,Still in the same moment I saw that the face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7822,8043,NA,Still in the same moment I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8045,8207,NA,It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand millweirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past I was taken on board the galley
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8209,8304,NA,Herbert was there and Startop was there but our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8306,8682,NA,What with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of her steam and her driving on and our driving on I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8684,8754,NA,Presently a dark object was seen in it bearing towards us on the tide
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8756,8880,NA,No man spoke but the steersman held up his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and true before it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8882,8959,NA,As it came nearer I saw it to be Magwitch swimming but not swimming freely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8961,9031,NA,He was taken on board and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9033,9116,NA,The galley was kept steady and the silent eager lookout at the water was resumed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9118,9226,NA,But the Rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not understanding what had happened came on at speed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9228,9373,NA,By the time she had been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9375,9504,NA,The lookout was kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but everybody knew that it was hopeless now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9506,9643,NA,At length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9645,9795,NA,Here I was able to get some comforts for MagwitchProvis no longerwho had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the head
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9797,9922,NA,He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,54,NA,hought he had received against the side of the galley
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,56,444,NA,He added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson but that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him Magwitch out of our boat and the endeavour of his captor to keep him in it had capsized us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,446,641,NA,He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each others arms and that there had been a struggle under water and that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,643,714,NA,I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,716,797,NA,The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,799,1043,NA,When I asked this officers permission to change the prisoners wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the publichouse he gave it readily merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1045,1121,NA,So the pocketbook which had once been in my hands passed into the officers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1123,1236,NA,He further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London but declined to accord that grace to my two friends
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1238,1399,NA,The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1401,1503,NA,His interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1505,1681,NA,Probably it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1683,1803,NA,We remained at the publichouse until the tide turned and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1805,1877,NA,Herbert and Startop were to get to London by land as soon as they could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1879,2005,NA,We had a doleful parting and when I took my place by Magwitchs side I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2007,2299,NA,For now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his I only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a series of years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2301,2359,NA,I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2361,2469,NA,His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on and often he could not repress a groan
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2471,2678,NA,I tried to rest him on the arm I could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was unquestionably best that he should die
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2680,2785,NA,That there were still living people enough who were able and willing to identify him I could not doubt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2787,2839,NA,That he would be leniently treated I could not hope
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2841,3089,NA,He who had been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3091,3290,NA,As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back I told him how grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3292,3353,NA,Dear boy he answered Im quite content to take my chance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3355,3410,NA,Ive seen my boy and he can be a gentleman without me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3412,3414,NA,No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3416,3478,NA,I had thought about that while we had been there side by side
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3480,3554,NA,No Apart from any inclinations of my own I understood Wemmicks hint now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3556,3636,NA,I foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3638,3737,NA,Lookee here dear boy said he Its best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3739,3799,NA,Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger Wemmick

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3979,4227,NA,Please God I will be as true to you as you have been to me I felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat and I heard that old sound in his throatsoftened now like all the rest of him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4229,4430,NA,It was a good thing that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too latethat he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4432,4442,NA,Chapter LV
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4444,4673,NA,He was taken to the Police Court next day and would have been immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prisonship from which he had once escaped to speak to his identity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4675,4886,NA,Nobody doubted it but Compeyson who had meant to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give the required evidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4888,5055,NA,I had gone direct to Mr Jaggers at his private house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and Mr Jaggers on the prisoners behalf would admit nothing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5057,5230,NA,It was the sole resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5232,5321,NA,I imparted to Mr Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5323,5488,NA,Mr Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialise by and by and try at all events for some of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5490,5671,NA,But he did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5673,5700,NA,I understood that very well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5702,5898,NA,I was not related to the outlaw or connected with him by any recognisable tie he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his apprehension and to do so now would be idle
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5900,6078,NA,I had no claim and I finally resolved and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6080,6257,NA,There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitchs affairs
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6259,6466,NA,When his body was found many miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets notes were still legible folded in a case he carried
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6468,6617,NA,Among these were the name of a bankinghouse in New South Wales where a sum of money was and the designation of certain lands of considerable value
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6619,6766,NA,Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch while in prison gave to Mr Jaggers of the possessions he supposed I should inherit
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6768,6898,NA,His ignorance poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe with Mr Jaggerss aid
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6900,7072,NA,After three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prisonship the witness came and completed the easy case
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7074,7161,NA,He was committed to take his trial at the next Sessions which would come on in a month
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7163,7328,NA,It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening a good deal cast down and said My dear Handel I fear I shall soon have to leave you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7330,7407,NA,His partner having prepared me for that I was less surprised than he thought
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7409,7660,NA,We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo and I am very much afraid I must go Handel when you most need me Herbert I shall always need you because I shall always love you but my need is no greater now than at another time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7662,7685,NA,You will be so lonely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7687,7864,NA,I have not leisure to think of that said I You know that I am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that I should be with him all day long if I could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7866,7936,NA,And when I come away from him you know that my thoughts are with him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7938,8064,NA,The dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8066,8212,NA,My dear fellow said Herbert let the near prospect of our separationfor it is very nearbe my justification for troubling you about yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8214,8299,NA,Have you thought of your future No for I have been afraid to think of any future
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8301,8386,NA,But yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear Handel it must not be dismissed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8388,8614,NA,I wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly words go with me I will said I In this branch house of ours Handel we must have a I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so I said A clerk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8616,8624,NA,A clerk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8626,8743,NA,And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8745,8801,NA,Now Handelin short my dear boy will you come to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8803,9069,NA,There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying Now Handel as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9071,9390,NA,Clara and I have talked about it again and again Herbert pursued and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her husbands friend that he is her friend too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9392,9425,NA,We should get on so well Handel
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9427,9552,NA,I thanked her heartily and I thanked him heartily but said I could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9554,9632,NA,Firstly my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9634,9647,NA,SecondlyYes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9649,9773,NA,Secondly there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9775,9939,NA,But if you thought Herbert that you could without doing any injury to your business leave the question open for a little while For any while cried Herbert

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2,196,NA,three months at most Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,198,336,NA,And Clara said I The dear little thing returned Herbert holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts but he wont last long
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,338,393,NA,Mrs Whimple confides to me that he is certainly going
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,395,465,NA,Not to say an unfeeling thing said I he cannot do better than go
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,467,646,NA,I am afraid that must be admitted said Herbert and then I shall come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,648,656,NA,Remember
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,658,789,NA,The blessed darling comes of no family my dear Handel and never looked into the red book and hasnt a notion about her grandpapa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,791,831,NA,What a fortune for the son of my mother
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,833,992,NA,On the Saturday in that same week I took my leave of Herbertfull of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave meas he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,994,1242,NA,I went into a coffeehouse to write a little note to Clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and over again and then went to my lonely homeif it deserved the name for it was now no home to me and I had no home anywhere
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1244,1362,NA,On the stairs I encountered Wemmick who was coming down after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1364,1558,NA,I had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1560,1814,NA,The late Compeyson said Wemmick had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being always in trouble that I heard what I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1816,1962,NA,I kept my ears open seeming to have them shut until I heard that he was absent and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1964,2085,NA,I can only suppose now that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to deceive his own instruments
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2087,2122,NA,You dont blame me I hope Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2124,2174,NA,I am sure I tried to serve you with all my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2176,2291,NA,I am as sure of that Wemmick as you can be and I thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2293,2324,NA,Thank you thank you very much
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2326,2436,NA,Its a bad job said Wemmick scratching his head and I assure you I havent been so cut up for a long time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2438,2498,NA,What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2500,2573,NA,Dear me What  I  think of Wemmick is the poor owner of the property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2575,2606,NA,Yes to be sure said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2608,2737,NA,Of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him and Id put down a fivepound note myself to get him out of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2739,2765,NA,But what I look at is this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2767,2934,NA,The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being so determined to bring him to book I do not think he could have been saved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2936,2998,NA,Whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3000,3072,NA,Thats the difference between the property and the owner dont you see
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3074,3177,NA,I invited Wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3179,3205,NA,He accepted the invitation
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3207,3475,NA,While he was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to it and after having appeared rather fidgety What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday Mr Pip Why I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3477,3524,NA,These twelve years more likely said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3526,3530,NA,Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3532,3559,NA,Im going to take a holiday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3561,3601,NA,More than that Im going to take a walk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3603,3663,NA,More than that Im going to ask you to take a walk with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3665,3762,NA,I was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then when Wemmick anticipated me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3764,3841,NA,I know your engagements said he and I know you are out of sorts Mr Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3843,3903,NA,But if you  could  oblige me I should take it as a kindness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3905,3948,NA,It aint a long walk and its an early one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3950,4028,NA,Say it might occupy you including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4030,4073,NA,Couldnt you stretch a point and manage it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4075,4159,NA,He had done so much for me at various times that this was very little to do for him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4161,4278,NA,I said I could manage itwould manage itand he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence that I was pleased too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4280,4416,NA,At his particular request I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning and so we parted for the time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4418,4604,NA,Punctual to my appointment I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning and was received by Wemmick himself who struck me as looking tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4606,4679,NA,Within there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4681,4813,NA,The Aged must have been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his bedroom I observed that his bed was empty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4815,5048,NA,When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishingrod and put it over his shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5050,5144,NA,Why we are not going fishing said I No returned Wemmick but I like to walk with one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5146,5205,NA,I thought this odd however I said nothing and we set off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5207,5302,NA,We went towards Camberwell Green and when we were thereabouts Wemmick said suddenly Halloa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5304,5320,NA,Heres a church
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5322,5472,NA,There was nothing very surprising in that but again I was rather surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea Lets go in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5474,5552,NA,We went in Wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch and looked all round
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5554,5654,NA,In the mean time Wemmick was diving into his coatpockets and getting something out of paper there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5656,5709,NA,Halloa said he Heres a couple of pair of gloves
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5711,5728,NA,Lets put em on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5730,5864,NA,As the gloves were white kid gloves and as the postoffice was widened to its utmost extent I now began to have my strong suspicions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5866,5965,NA,They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door escorting a lady
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5967,5989,NA,Halloa said Wemmick
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5991,6012,NA,Heres Miss Skiffins
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6014,6035,NA,Lets have a wedding
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6037,6168,NA,That discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6170,6256,NA,The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6258,6593,NA,The old gentleman however experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on that Wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe resistance
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6595,6665,NA,By dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to perfection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6667,6751,NA,The clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at those fatal rails
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6753,6931,NA,True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation I heard Wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoatpocket before the service began Halloa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6933,6947,NA,Heres a ring
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6949,7134,NA,I acted in the capacity of backer or bestman to the bridegroom while a little limp pewopener in a soft bonnet like a babys made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7136,7287,NA,The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged which led to the clergymans being unintentionally scandalised and it happened thus
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7289,7494,NA,When he said Who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentleman not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7496,7583,NA,Upon which the clergyman said again WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7585,7745,NA,The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice Now Aged P you know who giveth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7747,7861,NA,To which the Aged replied with great briskness before saying that  he  gave All right John all right my boy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7863,7998,NA,And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8000,8165,NA,It was completely done however and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and put the cover on again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8167,8265,NA,Mrs Wemmick more heedful of the future put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8267,8655,NA, Now  Mr Pip said Wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishingrod as we came out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a weddingparty Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8657,8926,NA,It was pleasant to observe that Mrs Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmicks arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a highbacked chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8928,9073,NA,We had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on table Wemmick said Provided by contract you know dont be afraid of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9075,9211,NA,I drank to the new couple drank to the Aged drank to the Castle saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as I could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9213,9304,NA,Wemmick came down to the door with me and I again shook hands with him and wished him joy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9306,9348,NA,Thankee said Wemmick rubbing his hands
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9350,9398,NA,Shes such a manager of fowls you have no idea
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9400,9448,NA,You shall have some eggs and judge for yourself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9450,9500,NA,I say Mr Pip calling me back and speaking low
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9502,9551,NA,This is altogether a Walworth sentiment please
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9553,9566,NA,I understand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9568,9630,NA,Not to be mentioned in Little Britain said I Wemmick nodded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9632,9709,NA,After what you let out the other day Mr Jaggers may as well not know of it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9711,9775,NA,He might think my brain was softening or something of the kind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9777,9788,NA,Chapter LVI
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9790,9911,NA,He lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9913,10001,NA,He had broken two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great pai

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,41,NA,in and difficulty which increased daily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,43,154,NA,It was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke very little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,156,295,NA,But he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what I knew he ought to hear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,297,408,NA,Being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after the first day or so into the infirmary
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,410,490,NA,This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,492,625,NA,And but for his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a determined prisonbreaker and I know not what else
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,627,836,NA,Although I saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,838,1014,NA,I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better he wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day when the prison door closed upon him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1016,1104,NA,The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1106,1309,NA,I sometimes derived an impression from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1311,1420,NA,But he never justified himself by a hint tending that way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1422,1571,NA,It happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1573,1775,NA,A smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look as if he were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when I was a little child
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1777,1854,NA,As to all the rest he was humble and contrite and I never knew him complain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1856,1993,NA,When the Sessions came round Mr Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1995,2083,NA,It was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long and was refused
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2085,2169,NA,The trial came on at once and when he was put to the bar he was seated in a chair
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2171,2298,NA,No objection was made to my getting close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2300,2339,NA,The trial was very short and very clear
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2341,2467,NA,Such things as could be said for him were saidhow he had taken to industrious habits and had thriven lawfully and reputably
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2469,2571,NA,But nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2573,2649,NA,It was impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2651,2855,NA,At that time it was the custom as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2857,3077,NA,But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me I could scarcely believe even as I write these words that I saw twoandthirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3079,3180,NA,Foremost among the twoandthirty was he seated that he might get breath enough to keep life in him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3182,3347,NA,The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court glittering in the rays of April sun
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3349,3594,NA,Penned in the dock as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine were the twoandthirty men and women some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3596,3701,NA,There had been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been stilled and a hush had succeeded
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3703,3936,NA,The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great gallery full of peoplea large theatrical audiencelooked on as the twoandthirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3938,3967,NA,Then the Judge addressed them
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3969,4356,NA,Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments and punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his escape and been resentenced to exile for life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4358,4538,NA,That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and honest life
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4540,4784,NA,But in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had come back to the country where he was proscribed

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5649,5841,NA,Rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this way of light the prisoner said My Lord I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty but I bow to yours and sat down again

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4299,4433,NA,Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread I dont know what they did except that they forbore to remove me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4435,5038,NA,That I had a fever and was avoided that I suffered greatly that I often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity that I was a brick in the housewall and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me that I was a steel beam of a vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered off that I passed through these phases of disease I know of my own remembrance and did in some sort know at the time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5040,5296,NA,That I sometimes struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me down I also knew at the time

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5948,6069,NA,I opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the windowseat smoking his pipe in the shaded open window still I saw Joe

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6143,6262,NA,I sank back on my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6264,6321,NA,At last one day I took courage and said  Is  it Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6323,6385,NA,And the dear old homevoice answered Which it air old chap

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6859,6985,NA,And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him I lay there penitently whispering O God bless him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6987,7130,NA,O God bless this gentle Christian man Joes eyes were red when I next found him beside me but I was holding his hand and we both felt happy

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8322,8573,NA,There Joe cut himself short and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times whether I felt inclined for it or not and that I was to submit myself to all his orders
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8575,8676,NA,So I kissed his hand and lay quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy with my love in it

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9356,9667,NA,It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long while at every upstroke I could hear his pen spluttering extensively
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9669,9834,NA,He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into space and seemed quite satisfied with the result

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4151,4342,NA,Which I do assure you Pip he would often say in explanation of that liberty I found her a tapping the spare bed like a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4344,4568,NA,Which she would have tapped yourn next and drawd it off with you a laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the souptureen and wegetabledishes and the wine and spirits in your Wellington boots
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4570,4693,NA,We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4695,4955,NA,And when the day came and an open carriage was got into the Lane Joe wrapped me up took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4957,5142,NA,And Joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass and sweet summer scents filled all the air
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5144,5556,NA,The day happened to be Sunday and when I looked on the loveliness around me and thought how it had grown and changed and how the little wildflowers had been forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and by night under the sun and under the stars while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5558,5889,NA,But when I heard the Sunday bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty I felt that I was not nearly thankful enoughthat I was too weak yet to be even thatand I laid my head on Joes shoulder as I had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not and it was too much for my young senses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5891,6003,NA,More composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used to talk lying on the grass at the old Battery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6005,6040,NA,There was no change whatever in Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6042,6153,NA,Exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my eyes still just as simply faithful and as simply right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6155,6343,NA,When we got back again and he lifted me out and carried meso easilyacross the court and up the stairs I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6345,6468,NA,We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did I know how much of my late history he was acquainted with
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6470,6611,NA,I was so doubtful of myself now and put so much trust in him that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he did not
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6613,6813,NA,Have you heard Joe I asked him that evening upon further consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was I heerd returned Joe as it were not Miss Havisham old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6815,6852,NA,Did you hear who it was Joe Well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6854,6972,NA,I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the banknotes at the Jolly Bargemen Pip So it was
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6974,7019,NA,Astonishing said Joe in the placidest way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7021,7104,NA,Did you hear that he was dead Joe I presently asked with increasing diffidence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7106,7112,NA,Which
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7114,7153,NA,Him as sent the banknotes Pip Yes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7155,7350,NA,I think said Joe after meditating a long time and looking rather evasively at the windowseat as I  did  hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7352,7512,NA,Did you hear anything of his circumstances Joe Not partickler Pip If you would like to hear Joe I was beginning when Joe got up and came to my sofa
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7514,7564,NA,Lookee here old chap said Joe bending over me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7566,7636,NA,Ever the best of friends aint us Pip I was ashamed to answer him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7638,7728,NA,Wery good then said Joe as if I  had  answered thats all right thats agreed upon
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7730,7821,NA,Then why go into subjects old chap which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7823,7892,NA,Theres subjects enough as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7894,7898,NA,Lord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7900,7945,NA,To think of your poor sister and her Rampages
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7947,8151,NA,And dont you remember Tickler I do indeed Joe Lookee here old chap said Joe I done what I could to keep you and Tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8153,8396,NA,For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it were not so much said Joe in his favourite argumentative way that she dropped into me too if I put myself in opposition to her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8398,8412,NA,I noticed that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8414,8592,NA,It aint a grab at a mans whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister was quite welcome that ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8594,8767,NA,But when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up and says to himself Where is the good as you are adoing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8769,8837,NA,I grant you I see the arm says the man but I dont see the good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8839,8894,NA,I call upon you sir therefore to pint out the good
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8896,8910,NA,The man says
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8912,8953,NA,I observed as Joe waited for me to speak
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8955,8983,NA,The man says Joe assented
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8985,9095,NA,Is he right that man Dear Joe he is always right Well old chap said Joe then abide by your words
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9097,9408,NA,If hes always right which in general hes more likely wrong hes right when he says this Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you was a little child you kep it mostly because you knowd as J Gargerys power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his inclinations
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9410,9518,NA,Theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9520,9695,NA,Biddy giv herself a deal o trouble with me afore I left for I am almost awful dull as I should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as I should so put it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9697,9814,NA,Both of which said Joe quite charmed with his logical arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9816,9822,NA,Namely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9824,9952,NA,You mustnt go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,161,NA,e and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddywho with her womans wit had found me out so soonhad prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,163,312,NA,But whether Joe knew how poor I was and how my great expectations had all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun I could not understand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,314,540,NA,Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of was this As I became stronger and better Joe became a little less easy with me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,542,725,NA,In my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names the dear old Pip old chap that now were music in my ears
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,727,801,NA,I too had fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,803,1028,NA,But imperceptibly though I held by them fast Joes hold upon them began to slacken and whereas I wondered at this at first I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was all mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1030,1157,NA,Ah Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1159,1365,NA,Had I given Joes innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go before I plucked myself away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1367,1516,NA,It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joes arm that I saw this change in him very plainly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1518,1634,NA,We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the river and I chanced to say as we got up See Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1636,1661,NA,I can walk quite strongly
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1663,1705,NA,Now you shall see me walk back by myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1707,1795,NA,Which do not overdo it Pip said Joe but I shall be happy fur to see you able sir
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1797,1852,NA,The last word grated on me but how could I remonstrate
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1854,1973,NA,I walked no further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker than I was and asked Joe for his arm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1975,2009,NA,Joe gave it me but was thoughtful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2011,2145,NA,I for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2147,2313,NA,That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed and what I had come down to I do not seek to conceal but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2315,2455,NA,He would want to help me out of his little savings I knew and I knew that he ought not to help me and that I must not suffer him to do it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2457,2500,NA,It was a thoughtful evening with both of us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2502,2650,NA,But before we went to bed I had resolved that I would wait over tomorrowtomorrow being Sundayand would begin my new course with the new week
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2652,2933,NA,On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve I would tell him what I had in my thoughts that Secondly not yet arrived at and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2935,3036,NA,As I cleared Joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3038,3135,NA,We had a quiet day on the Sunday and we rode out into the country and then walked in the fields
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3137,3188,NA,I feel thankful that I have been ill Joe I said
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3190,3331,NA,Dear old Pip old chap youre amost come round sir It has been a memorable time for me Joe Likeways for myself sir Joe returned
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3333,3391,NA,We have had a time together Joe that I can never forget
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3393,3485,NA,There were days once I know that I did for a while forget but I never shall forget these
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3487,3566,NA,Pip said Joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has been larks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3568,3619,NA,And dear sir what have been betwixt ushave been
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3621,3716,NA,At night when I had gone to bed Joe came into my room as he had done all through my recovery
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3718,3781,NA,He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3783,3805,NA,Yes dear Joe quite
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3807,3879,NA,And are always a getting stronger old chap Yes dear Joe steadily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3881,4001,NA,Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and said in what I thought a husky voice Good night
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4003,4119,NA,When I got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all without delay
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4121,4154,NA,I would tell him before breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4156,4260,NA,I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him for it was the first day I had been up early
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4262,4302,NA,I went to his room and he was not there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4304,4351,NA,Not only was he not there but his box was gone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4353,4416,NA,I hurried then to the breakfasttable and on it found a letter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4418,4553,NA,These were its brief contents Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4555,4559,NA,PS
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4561,4586,NA,Ever the best of friends
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4588,4676,NA,Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4678,4811,NA,Down to that moment I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4813,4917,NA,I had never dreamed of Joes having paid the money but Joe had paid it and the receipt was in his name
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4919,5235,NA,What remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts and had formed into a settled purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5237,5471,NA,The purpose was that I would go to Biddy that I would show her how humbled and repentant I came back that I would tell her how I had lost all I once hoped for that I would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5473,5661,NA,Then I would say to her Biddy I think you once liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5663,5993,NA,If you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like a forgiven child and indeed I am as sorry Biddy and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand I hope I am a little worthier of you that I wasnot much but a little
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5995,6297,NA,And Biddy it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which I set aside when it was offered until I knew your answer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6299,6512,NA,And now dear Biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man for it and I will try hard to make it a better world for you
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6514,6533,NA,Such was my purpose
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6535,6621,NA,After three days more of recovery I went down to the old place to put it in execution
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6623,6670,NA,And how I sped in it is all I have left to tell
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6672,6685,NA,Chapter LVIII
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6687,6815,NA,The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighbourhood before I got there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6817,6937,NA,I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence and I found that it made a great change in the Boars demeanour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6939,7121,NA,Whereas the Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of property
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7123,7212,NA,It was evening when I arrived much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7214,7424,NA,The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and postchaises up the yard
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7426,7607,NA,But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7609,7700,NA,Early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready I strolled round by Satis House
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7702,7867,NA,There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects next week
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7869,7943,NA,The House itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled down
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7945,8085,NA,LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8087,8276,NA,Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8278,8638,NA,Stepping in for a moment at the open gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there I saw the auctioneers clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a cataloguecompiler pen in hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8640,8751,NA,When I got back to my breakfast in the Boars coffeeroom I found Mr Pumblechook conversing with the landlord
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8753,8937,NA,Mr Pumblechook not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and addressed me in the following terms Young man I am sorry to see you brought low
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8939,8970,NA,But what else could be expected
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8972,9000,NA,what else could be expected
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9002,9124,NA,As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel I took it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9126,9195,NA,William said Mr Pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9197,9281,NA,And has it come to this Has it come to this I frowningly sat down to my breakfast
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9283,9435,NA,Mr Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my teabefore I could touch the teapotwith the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9437,9498,NA,William said Mr Pumblechook mournfully put the salt on
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9500,9557,NA,In happier times addressing me I think you took sugar
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9559,9580,NA,And did you take milk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9582,9589,NA,You did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9591,9605,NA,Sugar and milk
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9607,9635,NA,William bring a watercress
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9637,9697,NA,Thank you said I shortly but I dont eat watercresses
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9699,9896,NA,You dont eat em returned Mr Pumblechook sighing and nodding his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9898,9903,NA,True
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9905,9935,NA,The simple fruits of the earth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9937,9939,NA,No
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9941,9972,NA,You neednt bring any William

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1,170,NA, and Mr Pumblechook continued to stand over me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did Little more than skin and bone mused Mr Pumblechook aloud
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,172,315,NA,And yet when he went from here I may say with my blessing and I spread afore him my humble store like the Bee he was as plump as a Peach
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,317,553,NA,This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying May I and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,555,605,NA,Hah he went on handing me the bread and butter
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,607,739,NA,And air you agoing to Joseph In heavens name said I firing in spite of myself what does it matter to you where I am going
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,741,765,NA,Leave that teapot alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,767,864,NA,It was the worst course I could have taken because it gave Pumblechook the opportunity he wanted
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,866,1081,NA,Yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door I  will  leave that teapot alone
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1083,1107,NA,You are right young man
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1109,1131,NA,For once you are right
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1133,1340,NA,I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1342,1507,NA,And yet said Pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at arms length this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy infancy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1509,1558,NA,Tell me not it cannot be I tell you this is him
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1560,1593,NA,A low murmur from the two replied
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1595,1642,NA,The waiter appeared to be particularly affected
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1644,1708,NA,This is him said Pumblechook as I have rode in my shaycart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1710,1755,NA,This is him as I have seen brought up by hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1757,1899,NA,This is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage as her name was Georgiana Mria from her own mother let him deny it if he can
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1901,1993,NA,The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it and that it gave the case a black look
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1995,2096,NA,Young man said Pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old fashion you air agoing to Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2098,2158,NA,What does it matter to me you ask me where you air agoing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2160,2205,NA,I say to you Sir you air agoing to Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2207,2272,NA,The waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2274,2458,NA,Now said Pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive I will tell you what to say to Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2460,2615,NA,Here is Squires of the Boar present known and respected in this town and here is William which his fathers name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2617,2648,NA,You do not sir said William
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2650,2742,NA,In their presence pursued Pumblechook I will tell you young man what to say to Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2744,2837,NA,Says you Joseph I have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortuns
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2839,3022,NA,I will name no names Joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and I have seen that man I swear I dont see him here said I Say that likewise retorted Pumblechook
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3024,3090,NA,Say you said that and even Joseph will probably betray surprise
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3092,3146,NA,There you quite mistake him said I I know better
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3148,3268,NA,Says you Pumblechook went on Joseph I have seen that man and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3270,3435,NA,He knows your character Joseph and is well acquainted with your pigheadedness and ignorance and he knows my character Joseph and he knows my want of gratitoode
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3437,3567,NA,Yes Joseph says you here Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3570,3603,NA,He  knows it Joseph as none can
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3606,3679,NA,You  do not know it Joseph having no call to know it but that man do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3681,3773,NA,Windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3775,3847,NA,Says you Joseph he gave me a little message which I will now repeat
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3849,3918,NA,It was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of Providence
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3920,3981,NA,He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph and he saw it plain
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3983,4017,NA,It pinted out this writing Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4020,4095,NA,Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor and founder of fortuns 
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4097,4160,NA,But that man said he did not repent of what he had done Joseph
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4162,4172,NA,Not at all
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4174,4273,NA,It was right to do it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4275,4410,NA,Its pity said I scornfully as I finished my interrupted breakfast that the man did not say what he had done and would do again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4412,4492,NA,Squires of the Boar Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and William
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4494,4688,NA,I have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to do it benevolent to do it and that I would do it again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4690,4872,NA,With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand with an air and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4874,5142,NA,I was not long after him in leaving the house too and when I went down the High Street I saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5144,5317,NA,But it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be contrasted with this brazen pretender
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5319,5513,NA,I went towards them slowly for my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5515,5545,NA,The June weather was delicious
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5547,5714,NA,The sky was blue the larks were soaring high over the green corn I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5716,5952,NA,Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved beguiled my way
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5954,6182,NA,They awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened by my return and such a change had come to pass that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings had lasted many years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6184,6343,NA,The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen but the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village for quietness sake took me past it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6345,6452,NA,I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday no children were there and Biddys house was closed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6454,6580,NA,Some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6582,6717,NA,But the forge was a very short distance off and I went towards it under the sweet green limes listening for the clink of Joes hammer
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6719,6835,NA,Long after I ought to have heard it and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy all was still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6837,7051,NA,The limes were there and the white thorns were there and the chestnuttrees were there and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen but the clink of Joes hammer was not in the midsummer wind
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7053,7164,NA,Almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge I saw it at last and saw that it was closed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7166,7258,NA,No gleam of fire no glittering shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7260,7434,NA,But the house was not deserted and the best parlour seemed to be in use for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window was open and gay with flowers
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7436,7542,NA,I went softly towards it meaning to peep over the flowers when Joe and Biddy stood before me arm in arm
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7544,7654,NA,At first Biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but in another moment she was in my embrace
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7656,7783,NA,I wept to see her and she wept to see me I because she looked so fresh and pleasant she because I looked so worn and white
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7785,7900,NA,But dear Biddy how smart you are Yes dear Pip And Joe how smart  you  are Yes dear old Pip old chap
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7902,7982,NA,I looked at both of them from one to the other and then Its my weddingday
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7984,8134,NA,cried Biddy in a burst of happiness and I am married to Joe They had taken me into the kitchen and I had laid my head down on the old deal table
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8136,8220,NA,Biddy held one of my hands to her lips and Joes restoring touch was on my shoulder
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8222,8293,NA,Which he warnt strong enough my dear fur to be surprised said Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8295,8373,NA,And Biddy said I ought to have thought of it dear Joe but I was too happy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8375,8542,NA,They were both so overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to them so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8544,8646,NA,My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8648,8718,NA,How often while he was with me in my illness had it risen to my lips
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8720,8816,NA,How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8818,9029,NA,Dear Biddy said I you have the best husband in the whole world and if you could have seen him by my bed you would haveBut no you couldnt love him better than you do No I couldnt indeed said Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9031,9256,NA,And dear Joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble Joe Joe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9258,9447,NA,And Joe and Biddy both as you have been to church today and are in charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me and all I have so ill repaid
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9449,9833,NA,And when I say that I am going away within the hour for I am soon going abroad and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison and have sent it to you dont think dear Joe and Biddy that if I could repay it a thousand times over I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you or that I would do so if I could
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9835,9909,NA,They were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9911,9931,NA,But I must say more
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9933,10001,NA,Dear Joe I hope you will have children to love and that some little

"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,129,408,NA,Dont tell him Joe that I was thankless dont tell him Biddy that I was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that I honoured you both because you were both so good and true and that as your child I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,410,502,NA,I aint agoing said Joe from behind his sleeve to tell him nothink o that natur Pip
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,504,519,NA,Nor Biddy aint
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,521,542,NA,Nor yet no one aint
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,544,657,NA,And now though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts pray tell me both that you forgive me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,659,953,NA,Pray let me hear you say the words that I may carry the sound of them away with me and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of me in the time to come O dear old Pip old chap said Joe God knows as I forgive you if I have anythink to forgive Amen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,955,988,NA,And God knows I do echoed Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,990,1078,NA,Now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few minutes by myself
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1080,1209,NA,And then when I have eaten and drunk with you go with me as far as the fingerpost dear Joe and Biddy before we say goodbye
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1211,1377,NA,I sold all I had and put aside as much as I could for a composition with my creditorswho gave me ample time to pay them in fulland I went out and joined Herbert
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1379,1540,NA,Within a month I had quitted England and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1542,1795,NA,For the beam across the parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barleys growls and was at peace and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,1797,2002,NA,Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House but I lived happily with Herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my debts and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2004,2211,NA,It was not until I became third in the Firm that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert but he then declared that the secret of Herberts partnership had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2213,2346,NA,So he told it and Herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2348,2446,NA,I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House or that we made mints of money
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2448,2557,NA,We were not in a grand way of business but we had a good name and worked for our profits and did very well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2559,2828,NA,We owed so much to Herberts ever cheerful industry and readiness that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until I was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all but had been in me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2830,2841,NA,Chapter LIX
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,2843,3092,NA,For eleven years I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily eyesthough they had both been often before my fancy in the Eastwhen upon an evening in December an hour or two after dark I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3094,3159,NA,I touched it so softly that I was not heard and looked in unseen
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3161,3407,NA,There smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as ever though a little grey sat Joe and there fenced into the corner with Joes leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire wasI again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3409,3641,NA,We giv him the name of Pip for your sake dear old chap said Joe delighted when I took another stool by the childs side but I did  not  rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and we think he do
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3643,3769,NA,I thought so too and I took him out for a walk next morning and we talked immensely understanding one another to perfection
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,3771,4002,NA,And I took him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip late of this Parish and Also Georgiana Wife of the Above
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4004,4173,NA,Biddy said I when I talked with her after dinner as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap you must give Pip to me one of these days or lend him at all events
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4175,4203,NA,No no said Biddy gently
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4205,4221,NA,You must marry
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4223,4282,NA,So Herbert and Clara say but I dont think I shall Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4284,4349,NA,I have so settled down in their home that its not at all likely
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4351,4386,NA,I am already quite an old bachelor
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4388,4532,NA,Biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4534,4658,NA,There was something in the action and in the light pressure of Biddys weddingring that had a very pretty eloquence in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4660,4749,NA,Dear Pip said Biddy you are sure you dont fret for her O noI think not Biddy
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4751,4781,NA,Tell me as an old old friend
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4783,4943,NA,Have you quite forgotten her My dear Biddy I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there and little that ever had any place there
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,4945,5174,NA,But that poor dream as I once used to call it has all gone by Biddyall gone by Nevertheless I knew while I said those words that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5176,5188,NA,Yes even so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5190,5208,NA,For Estellas sake
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5210,5429,NA,I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality and meanness
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5431,5535,NA,And I had heard of the death of her husband from an accident consequent on his illtreatment of a horse
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5537,5632,NA,This release had befallen her some two years before for anything I knew she was married again
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5634,5770,NA,The early dinner hour at Joes left me abundance of time without hurrying my talk with Biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5772,5909,NA,But what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times the day had quite declined when I came to the place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,5911,6004,NA,There was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the wall of the old garden
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6006,6185,NA,The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence and looking over it I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6187,6251,NA,A gate in the fence standing ajar I pushed it open and went in
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6253,6340,NA,A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet up to scatter it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6342,6440,NA,But the stars were shining beyond the mist and the moon was coming and the evening was not dark
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6442,6576,NA,I could trace out where every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been and where the gates and where the casks
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6578,6678,NA,I had done so and was looking along the desolate garden walk when I beheld a solitary figure in it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6680,6731,NA,The figure showed itself aware of me as I advanced
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6733,6782,NA,It had been moving towards me but it stood still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6784,6838,NA,As I drew nearer I saw it to be the figure of a woman
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6840,6932,NA,As I drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when it stopped and let me come up with it
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,6934,7023,NA,Then it faltered as if much surprised and uttered my name and I cried out Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7025,7046,NA,I am greatly changed
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7048,7069,NA,I wonder you know me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7071,7182,NA,The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7184,7394,NA,Those attractions in it I had seen before what I had never seen before was the saddened softened light of the once proud eyes what I had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7396,7612,NA,We sat down on a bench that was near and I said After so many years it is strange that we should thus meet again Estella here where our first meeting was Do you often come back I have never been here since
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7614,7723,NA,Nor I The moon began to rise and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling which had passed away
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7725,7844,NA,The moon began to rise and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on earth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7846,7910,NA,Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,7912,8009,NA,I have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been prevented by many circumstances
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8011,8032,NA,Poor poor old place
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8034,8163,NA,The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8165,8343,NA,Not knowing that I saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said quietly Were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this condition
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8345,8359,NA,Yes Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8361,8386,NA,The ground belongs to me
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8388,8437,NA,It is the only possession I have not relinquished
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8439,8511,NA,Everything else has gone from me little by little but I have kept this
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8513,8599,NA,It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8601,8640,NA,Is it to be built on At last it is
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8642,8691,NA,I came here to take leave of it before its change
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8693,8792,NA,And you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wandereryou live abroad still Still
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8794,8894,NA,And do well I am sure I work pretty hard for a sufficient living and thereforeyes I do well
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8896,8939,NA,I have often thought of you said Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8941,8973,NA,Have you Of late very often
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,8975,9106,NA,There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9108,9228,NA,But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance I have given it a place in my heart
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9230,9287,NA,You have always held your place in my heart I answered
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9289,9329,NA,And we were silent again until she spoke
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9331,9426,NA,I little thought said Estella that I should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9428,9452,NA,I am very glad to do so
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9454,9482,NA,Glad to part again Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9484,9517,NA,To me parting is a painful thing
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9519,9597,NA,To me the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9599,9894,NA,But you said to me returned Estella very earnestly God bless you God forgive you And if you could say that to me then you will not hesitate to say that to me nownow when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9896,9955,NA,I have been bent and broken butI hopeinto a better shape
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,9957,10030,NA,Be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are friends
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,10032,10113,NA,We are friends said I rising and bending over her as she rose from the bench
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,10115,10162,NA,And will continue friends apart said Estella
"Dickens, Charles",Great Expectations,sentence,10164,10447,NA,I took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge so the evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me I saw no shadow of another parting from her
